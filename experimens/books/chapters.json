{"chapters": [{"page_content": "There is a strange sensation often experienced in the\npresence of an audience. It may proceed from the gaze\nof the many eyes that turn upon the speaker, especially\nif he permits himself to steadily return that gaze. Most\nspeakers have been conscious of this in a nameless thrill,\na real something, pervading the atmosphere, tangible,\nevanescent, indescribable. All writers have borne testi-\nmony to the power of a speaker's eye in impressing an\naudience. This influence which we are now considering\nis the reverse of that picture\u2014the power their eyes may\nexert upon him, especially before he begins to speak:\nafter the inward fires of oratory are fanned into flame\nthe eyes of the audience lose all terror.\u2014William Pit-\ntenger, Extempore Speech.\nStudents of public speaking continually ask, \"How can I\novercome self-consciousness and the fear that paralyzes me be-\nfore an audience?\"\nDid you ever notice in looking from a train window that some\nhorses feed near the track and never even pause to look up at\nthe thundering cars, while just ahead at the next railroad\ncrossing a farmer's wife will be nervously trying to quiet her\nscared horse as the train goes by?\nHow would you cure a horse that is afraid of cars\u2014graze him\nin a back-woods lot where he would never see steam-engines\nor automobiles, or drive or pasture him where he would fre-\nquently see the machines?\nApply horse-sense to ridding yourself of self-consciousness\nand fear: face an audience as frequently as you can, and you\n7\nwill soon stop shying. You can never attain freedom from stage-\nfright by reading a treatise. A book may give you excellent sug-\ngestions on how best to conduct yourself in the water, but\nsooner or later you must get wet, perhaps even strangle and be\n\"half scared to death.\" There are a great many \"wetless\"\nbathing suits worn at the seashore, but no one ever learns to\nswim in them. To plunge is the only way.\nPractise, practise, PRACTISE in speaking before an audience\nwill tend to remove all fear of audiences, just as practise in\nswimming will lead to confidence and facility in the water. You\nmust learn to speak by speaking.\nThe Apostle Paul tells us that every man must work out his\nown salvation. All we can do here is to offer you suggestions as\nto how best to prepare for your plunge. The real plunge no one\ncan take for you. A doctor may prescribe, but you must take\nthe medicine.\nDo not be disheartened if at first you suffer from stage-fright.\nDan Patch was more susceptible to suffering than a superannu-\nated dray horse would be. It never hurts a fool to appear be-\nfore an audience, for his capacity is not a capacity for feeling.\nA blow that would kill a civilized man soon heals on a savage.\nThe higher we go in the scale of life, the greater is the capacity\nfor suffering.\nFor one reason or another, some master-speakers never en-\ntirely overcome stage-fright, but it will pay you to spare no\npains to conquer it. Daniel Webster failed in his first appear-\nance and had to take his seat without finishing his speech be-\ncause he was nervous. Gladstone was often troubled with self-\nconsciousness in the beginning of an address. Beecher was al-\nways perturbed before talking in public.\nBlacksmiths sometimes twist a rope tight around the nose of\na horse, and by thus inflicting a little pain they distract his at-\ntention from the shoeing process. One way to get air out of a\nglass is to pour in water.\nBe Absorbed by Your Subject\nApply the blacksmith's homely principle when you are speak-\ning. If you feel deeply about your subject you will be able to\nthink of little else. Concentration is a process of distraction\nfrom less important matters. It is too late to think about the cut\nof your coat when once you are upon the platform, so centre\n8\nyour interest on what you are about to say\u2014fill your mind with\nyour speech-material and, like the infilling water in the glass, it\nwill drive out your unsubstantial fears.\nSelf-consciousness is undue consciousness of self, and, for\nthe purpose of delivery, self is secondary to your subject, not\nonly in the opinion of the audience, but, if you are wise, in your\nown. To hold any other view is to regard yourself as an exhibit\ninstead of as a messenger with a message worth delivering. Do\nyou remember Elbert Hubbard's tremendous little tract, \"A\nMessage to Garcia\"? The youth subordinated himself to the\nmessage he bore. So must you, by all the determination you\ncan muster. It is sheer egotism to fill your mind with thoughts\nof self when a greater thing is there\u2014TRUTH. Say this to your-\nself\nin-\nto quiescence. If the theater caught fire you could rush to the\nstage and shout directions to the audience without any self-\nconsciousness, for the importance of what you were saying\nwould drive all fear-thoughts out of your mind.\nself-consciousness\nsternly,\nshame\nyour\nand\nFar worse than self-consciousness through fear of doing\npoorly is self-consciousness through assumption of doing well.\nThe first sign of greatness is when a man does not attempt to\nlook and act great. Before you can call yourself a man at all,\nKipling assures us, you must \"not look too good nor talk too\nwise.\"\nNothing advertises itself so thoroughly as conceit. One may\nbe so full of self as to be empty. Voltaire said, \"We must\nconceal self-love.\" But that can not be done. You know this to\nbe true, for you have recognized overweening self-love in oth-\ners. If you have it, others are seeing it in you. There are things\nin this world bigger than self, and in working for them self will\nbe forgotten, or\u2014what is better\u2014remembered only so as to\nhelp us win toward higher things.\nHave Something to Say\nThe trouble with many speakers is that they go before an\naudience with their minds a blank. It is no wonder that nature,\nabhorring a vacuum, fills them with the nearest thing handy,\nwhich generally happens to be, \"I wonder if I am doing this\nright! How does my hair look? I know I shall fail.\" Their proph-\netic souls are sure to be right.\n9\nIt is not enough to be absorbed by your subject\u2014to acquire\nself-confidence you must have something in which to be confid-\nent. If you go before an audience without any preparation, or\nprevious knowledge of your subject, you ought to be self-con-\nscious\u2014you ought to be ashamed to steal the time of your audi-\nence. Prepare yourself. Know what you are going to talk about,\nand, in general, how you are going to say it. Have the first few\nsentences worked out completely so that you may not be\ntroubled in the beginning to find words. Know your subject bet-\nter than your hearers know it, and you have nothing to fear.\nAfter Preparing for Success, Expect It\nLet your bearing be modestly confident, but most of all be\nmodestly confident within. Over-confidence is bad, but to toler-\nate premonitions of failure is worse, for a bold man may win at-\ntention by his very bearing, while a rabbit-hearted coward in-\nvites disaster.\nHumility is not the personal discount that we must offer in\nthe presence of others\u2014against this old interpretation there\nhas been a most healthy modern reaction. True humility any\nman who thoroughly knows himself must feel; but it is not a\nhumility that assumes a worm-like meekness; it is rather a\nstrong, vibrant prayer for greater power for service\u2014a prayer\nthat Uriah Heep could never have uttered.\nWashington Irving once introduced Charles Dickens at a din-\nner given in the latter's honor. In the middle of his speech\nIrving hesitated, became embarrassed, and sat down awk-\nwardly. Turning to a friend beside him he remarked, \"There, I\ntold you I would fail, and I did.\"\nIf you believe you will fail, there is no hope for you. You will.\nRid yourself of this I-am-a-poor-worm-in-the-dust idea. You\nare a god, with infinite capabilities. \"All things are ready if the\nmind be so.\" The eagle looks the cloudless sun in the face.\nAssume Mastery Over Your Audience\nIn public speech, as in electricity, there is a positive and a\nnegative force. Either you or your audience are going to pos-\nsess the positive factor. If you assume it you can almost invari-\nably make it yours. If you assume the negative you are sure to\nbe negative. Assuming a virtue or a vice vitalizes it. Summon\nall your power of self-direction, and remember that though\nyour audience is infinitely more important than you, the truth\n10\nis more important than both of you, because it is eternal. If\nyour mind falters in its leadership the sword will drop from\nyour hands. Your assumption of being able to instruct or lead\nor inspire a multitude or even a small group of people may ap-\npall you as being colossal impudence\u2014as indeed it may be; but\nhaving\ncour-\nonce\nlies within you to be what you\nageous. BEcourageous\u2014it\nwill. MAKE yourself be calm and confident.\nessayed\nspeak,\nbe\nto\nReflect that your audience will not hurt you. If Beecher in\nLiverpool had spoken behind a wire screen he would have in-\nvited the audience to throw the over-ripe missiles with which\nthey were loaded; but he was a man, confronted his hostile\nhearers fearlessly\u2014and won them.\nIn facing your audience, pause a moment and look them\nover\u2014a hundred chances to one they want you to succeed, for\nwhat man is so foolish as to spend his time, perhaps his money,\nin the hope that you will waste his investment by talking dully?\nConcluding Hints\nDo not make haste to begin\u2014haste shows lack of control.\nDo not apologize. It ought not to be necessary; and if it is, it\nwill not help. Go straight ahead.\nTake a deep breath, relax, and begin in a quiet conversation-\nal tone as though you were speaking to one large friend. You\nwill not find it half so bad as you imagined; really, it is like tak-\ning a cold plunge: after you are in, the water is fine. In fact,\nhaving spoken a few times you will even anticipate the plunge\nwith exhilaration. To stand before an audience and make them\nthink your thoughts after you is one of the greatest pleasures\nyou can ever know. Instead of fearing it, you ought to be as\nanxious as the fox hounds straining at their leashes, or the race\nhorses tugging at their reins.\nfear,\nSo cast out\nfor fear is cowardly\u2014when it\nis not\nmastered. The bravest know fear, but they do not yield to it.\nFace your audience pluckily\u2014if your knees quake, MAKE them\nstop. In your audience lies some victory for you and the cause\nyou represent. Go win it. Suppose Charles Martell had been\nafraid to hammer the Saracen at Tours; suppose Columbus had\nfeared to venture out into the unknown West; suppose our fore-\nfathers had been too timid to oppose the tyranny of George the\nThird; suppose that any man who ever did anything worth\n11\nwhile had been a coward! The world owes its progress to\nthe men who have dared, and you must dare to speak the ef-\nfective word that is in your heart to speak\u2014for often it requires\ncourage to utter a single sentence. But remember that men\nerect no monuments and weave no laurels for those who fear\nto do what they can.\nIs all this unsympathetic, do you say?\nMan, what you need is not sympathy, but a push. No one\ndoubts that temperament and nerves and illness and even\npraiseworthy modesty may, singly or combined, cause the\nspeaker's cheek to blanch before an audience, but neither can\nany one doubt that coddling will magnify this weakness. The\nvictory lies in a fearless frame of mind. Prof. Walter Dill Scott\nsays: \"Success or failure in business is caused more by mental\nattitude even than by mental capacity.\" Banish the fear-atti-\ntude; acquire the confident attitude. And remember that the\nonly way to acquire it is\u2014to acquire it.\nIn this foundation chapter we have tried to strike the tone of\nmuch that is to follow. Many of these ideas will be amplified\nand enforced in a more specific way; but through all these\nchapters on an art which Mr. Gladstone believed to be more\npowerful than the public press, the note of justifiable self-con-\nfidence must sound again and again.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES.\n1. What is the cause of self-consciousness?\n2. Why are animals free from it?\n3. What is your observation regarding self-consciousness in\nchildren?\n4. Why are you free from it under the stress of unusual\nexcitement?\n5. How does moderate excitement affect you?\n6. What are the two fundamental requisites for the acquiring\nof self-confidence?

This is true of the\nwordmonotonous. From \"having but one tone,\" it has come to\nmean more broadly, \"lack of variation.\"\nThe monotonous speaker not only drones along in the same\nvolume and pitch of tone but uses always the same emphasis,\nthe same speed, the same thoughts\u2014or dispenses with thought\naltogether.\nMonotony, the cardinal and most common sin of the public\nspeaker, is not a transgression\u2014it is rather a sin of omission,\nfor it consists in living up to the confession of the Prayer Book:\n\"We have left undone those things we ought to have done.\"\nEmerson says, \"The virtue of art lies in detachment, in se-\nquestering one object from the embarrassing variety.\" That is\njust what the monotonous speaker fails to do\u2014he does not de-\ntach one thought or phrase from another, they are all ex-\npressed in the same manner.\nTo tell you that your speech is monotonous may mean very\nlittle to you, so let us look at the nature\u2014and the curse\u2014of\nmonotony in other spheres of life, then we shall appreciate\nmore fully how it will blight an otherwise good speech.\nIf the Victrola in the adjoining apartment grinds out just\nthree selections over and over again, it is pretty safe to assume\nthat your neighbor has no other records. If a speaker uses only\na few of his powers, it points very plainly to the fact that the\nrest of his powers are not developed. Monotony reveals our\nlimitations.\nIn its effect on its victim, monotony is actually deadly\u2014it will\ndrive the bloom from the cheek and the lustre from the eye as\n14\nquickly as sin, and often leads to viciousness. The worst pun-\nishment that human ingenuity has ever been able to invent is\nextreme monotony\u2014solitary confinement. Lay a marble on the\ntable and do nothing eighteen hours of the day but change that\nmarble from one point to another and back again, and you will\ngo insane if you continue long enough.\nSo this thing that shortens life, and is used as the most cruel\nof punishments in our prisons, is the thing that will destroy all\nthe life and force of a speech. Avoid it as you would shun a\ndeadly dull bore. The \"idle rich\" can have half-a-dozen homes,\ncommand all the varieties of foods gathered from the four\ncorners of the earth, and sail for Africa or Alaska at their pleas-\nure; but the poverty-stricken man must walk or take a street\ncar\u2014he does not have the choice of yacht, auto, or special\ntrain. He must spend the most of his life in labor and be con-\ntent with the staples of the food-market. Monotony is poverty,\nwhether in speech or in life. Strive to increase the variety of\nyour speech as the business man labors to augment his wealth.\nBird-songs, forest glens, and mountains are not monoton-\nous\u2014it is the long rows of brown-stone fronts and the miles of\npaved streets that are so terribly same. Nature in her wealth\ngives us endless variety; man with his limitations is often\nmonotonous. Get back to nature in your methods of speech-\nmaking.\nThe power of variety lies in its pleasure-giving quality. The\ngreat truths of the world have often been couched in fascinat-\ning stories\u2014\"Les Miserables,\" for instance. If you wish to teach\nor influence men, you must please them, first or last. Strike the\nsame note on the piano over and over again. This will give you\nsome idea of the displeasing, jarring effect monotony has on\nthe ear. The dictionary defines \"monotonous\" as being syn-\nonymous with \"wearisome.\" That is putting it mildly. It is mad-\ndening. The department-store prince does not disgust the pub-\nlic by playing only the one tune, \"Come Buy My Wares!\" He\ngives recitals on a $125,000 organ, and the pleased people nat-\nurally slip into a buying mood.\nHow to Conquer Monotony\nWe obviate monotony in dress by replenishing our ward-\nrobes. We avoid monotony in speech by multiplying our powers\n15\nof speech. We multiply our powers of speech by increasing our\ntools.\nThe carpenter has special implements with which to con-\nstruct the several parts of a building. The organist has certain\nkeys and stops which he manipulates to produce his harmonies\nand effects. In like manner the speaker has certain instruments\nand tools at his command by which he builds his argument,\nplays on the feelings, and guides the beliefs of his audience. To\ngive you a conception of these instruments, and practical help\nin learning to use them, are the purposes of the immediately\nfollowing chapters.\nWhy did not the Children of Israel whirl through the desert in\nlimousines, and why did not Noah have moving-picture enter-\ntainments and talking machines on the Ark? The laws that en-\nable us to operate an automobile, produce moving-pictures, or\nmusic on the Victrola, would have worked just as well then as\nthey do today. It was ignorance of law that for ages deprived\nhumanity of our modern conveniences. Many speakers still use\nox-cart methods in their speech instead of employing auto-\nmobile or overland-express methods. They are ignorant of laws\nthat make for efficiency in speaking. Just to the extent that you\nregard and use the laws that we are about to examine and\nlearn how to use will you have efficiency and force in your\nspeaking; and just to the extent that you disregard them will\nyour speaking be feeble and ineffective. We cannot impress too\nthoroughly upon you the necessity for a real working mastery\nof these principles. They are the very foundations of successful\nspeaking. \"Get your principles right,\" said Napoleon, \"and the\nrest is a matter of detail.\"\nIt is useless to shoe a dead horse, and all the sound prin-\nciples in Christendom will never make a live speech out of a\ndead one. So let it be understood that public speaking is not a\nmatter of mastering a few dead rules; the most important law\nof public speech is the necessity for truth, force, feeling, and\nlife. Forget all else, but not this.\nWhen you have mastered the mechanics of speech outlined in\nthe next few chapters you will no longer be troubled with\nmonotony. The complete knowledge of these principles and the\nability to apply them will give you great variety in your powers\nof expression. But they cannot be mastered and applied by\n16\nor\nreading\nprac-\nthinking\ntise, practise, PRACTISE.

They are all\nfounded on the practices that good speakers and actors ad-\nopt\u2014either naturally and unconsciously or under instruc-\ntion\u2014in getting their effects.\nIt is useless to warn the student that he must be natural. To\nbe natural may be to be monotonous. The little strawberry up\nin the arctics with a few tiny seeds and an acid tang is a natur-\nal berry, but it is not to be compared with the improved variety\nthat we enjoy here. The dwarfed oak on the rocky hillside is\nnatural, but a poor thing compared with the beautiful tree\nfound in the rich, moist bottom lands. Be natural\u2014but improve\nyour natural gifts until you have approached the ideal, for we\nmust strive after idealized nature, in fruit, tree, and speech.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES.\n1.

Baldwin, Writing and\nSpeaking.\nThe gun that scatters too much does not bag the birds. The\nsame principle applies to speech. The speaker that fires his\nforce and emphasis at random into a sentence will not get res-\nults. Not every word is of special importance\u2014therefore only\ncertain words demand emphasis.\nYou say MassaCHUsetts and MinneAPolis, you do not em-\nphasize each syllable alike, but hit the accented syllable with\nforce and hurry over the unimportant ones. Now why do you\nnot apply this principle in speaking a sentence? To some extent\nyou do, in ordinary speech; but do you in public discourse? It is\nthere that monotony caused by lack of emphasis is so painfully\napparent.\nSo far as emphasis is concerned, you may consider the aver-\nage sentence as just one big word, with the important word as\nthe accented syllable. Note the following:\n\"Destiny is not a matter of chance. It is a matter of choice.\"\nYou might as well say MASS-A-CHU-SETTS, emphasizing\nevery syllable equally, as to lay equal stress on each word in\nthe foregoing sentences.\nSpeak it aloud and see. Of course you will want to emphas-\nize destiny, for it is the principal idea in your declaration, and\nyou will put some emphasis on not, else your hearers may think\nyou are affirming that destiny is a matter of chance. By all\n18\nmeans you must emphasize chance, for it is one of the two big\nideas in the statement.\nAnother reason why chance takes emphasis is that it is con-\ntrasted with choice in the next sentence. Obviously, the author\nhas contrasted these ideas purposely, so that they might be\nmore emphatic, and here we see that contrast is one of the\nvery first devices to gain emphasis.\nAs a public speaker you can assist this emphasis of contrast\nwith your voice. If you say, \"My horse is not black,\" what color\nimmediately comes into mind? White, naturally, for that is the\nopposite of black. If you wish to bring out the thought that des-\ntiny is a matter of choice, you can do so more effectively by\nfirst saying that \"DESTINY is NOT a matter of CHANCE.\" Is\nnot the color of the horse impressed upon us more emphatic-\nally when you say, \"My horse is NOT BLACK. He is WHITE\"\nthan it would be by hearing you assert merely that your horse\nis white?\nIn the second sentence of the statement there is only one im-\nportant word\u2014choice. It is the one word that positively defines\nthe quality of the subject being discussed, and the author of\nthose lines desired to bring it out emphatically, as he has\nshown by contrasting it with another idea. These lines, then,\nwould read like this:\n\"DESTINY is NOT a matter of CHANCE.\nis a matter\nof CHOICE.\" Now read this over, striking the words in capitals\nwith a great deal of force.\nIt\nIn almost every sentence there are a few MOUNTAIN PEAK\nWORDS that represent the big, important ideas. When you pick\nup the evening paper you can tell at a glance which are the im-\nportant news articles. Thanks to the editor, he does not tell\nabout a \"hold up\" in Hong Kong in the same sized type as he\nuses to report the death of five firemen in your home city. Size\nof type is his device to show emphasis in bold relief. He brings\nout sometimes even in red headlines the striking news of the\nday.\nIt would be a boon to speech-making if speakers would con-\nserve the attention of their audiences in the same way and em-\nphasize only the words representing the important ideas. The\naverage speaker will deliver the foregoing line on destiny with\nabout the same amount of emphasis on each word. Instead of\n19\nsaying, \"It is a matter of CHOICE,\" he will deliver it, \"It is a\nmatter of choice,\" or \"IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE\"\u2014both\nequally bad.\nCharles Dana, the famous editor of The New York Sun, told\none of his reporters that if he went up the street and saw a dog\nbite a man, to pay no attention to it. The Sun could not afford\nto waste the time and attention of its readers on such unim-\nportant happenings. \"But,\" said Mr. Dana, \"if you see a man\nbite a dog, hurry back to the office and write the story.\" Of\ncourse that is news; that is unusual.\nNow the speaker who says \"IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE\" is\nputting too much emphasis upon things that are of no more im-\nportance to metropolitan readers than a dog bite, and when he\nfails to emphasize \"choice\" he is like the reporter who \"passes\nup\" the man's biting a dog. The ideal speaker makes his big\nwords stand out like mountain peaks; his unimportant words\nare submerged like stream-beds. His big thoughts stand like\nhuge oaks; his ideas of no especial value are merely like the\ngrass around the tree.\nFrom all\nthis we may deduce this\nciple: EMPHASIS is\nof CONTRAST and COMPARISON.\na\nimportant prin-\nmatter\nRecently the New York American featured an editorial by Ar-\nthur Brisbane.

Otherwise, it is\njustified.\"\nA Fifth Avenue bus would attract attention up at Minisink\nFord, New York, while one of the ox teams that frequently pass\nthere would attract attention on Fifth Avenue. To make a word\nemphatic, deliver it differently from the manner in which the\nwords surrounding it are delivered. If you have been talking\nloudly, utter the emphatic word in a concentrated whis-\nper\u2014and you have intense emphasis. If you have been going\nfast, go very slow on the emphatic word. If you have been talk-\ning on a low pitch, jump to a high one on the emphatic word. If\nyou have been talking on a high pitch, take a low one on your\nemphatic ideas. Read the chapters on \"Inflection,\" \"Feeling,\"\n\"Pause,\" \"Change of Pitch,\" \"Change of Tempo.\" Each of these\nwill explain in detail how to get emphasis through the use of a\ncertain principle.\nIn this chapter, however, we are considering only one form of\nemphasis: that of applying force to the important word and\nsubordinating the unimportant words. Do not forget: this is one\nof the main methods that you must continually employ in get-\nting your effects.\nLet us not confound loudness with emphasis. To yell is not a\nsign of earnestness, intelligence, or feeling. The kind of force\nthat we want applied to the emphatic word is not entirely phys-\nical. True, the emphatic word may be spoken more loudly, or it\nmay be spoken more softly, but the real quality desired is in-\ntensity, earnestness. It must come from within, outward.\nLast night a speaker said: \"The curse of this country is not a\nlack of education. It's politics.\" He emphasized curse,\nlack,\neducation, politics. The other words were hurried over and\nThe\nthus\nword politics was flamed out with great feeling as he slapped\nhis hands together indignantly. His emphasis was both correct\nand powerful. He concentrated all our attention on the words\ncomparative\nimportance\ngiven\nall.\nno\nat\n21\nthat meant something, instead of holding it up on such words\nas of this, a, of, It's.\nWhat would you think of a guide who agreed to show New\nYork to a stranger and then took up his time by visiting\nChinese laundries and boot-blacking \"parlors\" on the side\nstreets? There is only one excuse for a speaker's asking the at-\ntention of his audience: He must have either truth or entertain-\nment for them. If he wearies their attention with trifles they\nwill have neither vivacity nor desire left when he reaches\nwords of Wall-Street and skyscraper importance. You do not\ndwell on these small words in your everyday conversation, be-\ncause you are not a conversational bore. Apply the correct\nmethod of everyday speech to the platform. As we have noted\nelsewhere, public speaking is very much like conversation\nenlarged.\nSometimes, for big emphasis, it is advisable to lay stress on\nevery single syllable in a word, as absolutely in the following\nsentence:\nI ab-so-lute-ly refuse to grant your demand.\nNow and then this principle should be applied to an emphatic\nsentence by stressing each word. It is a good device for excit-\ning special attention, and it furnishes a pleasing variety. Pat-\nrick Henry's notable climax could be delivered in that manner\nvery\n\"Give\u2014me\u2014liberty\u2014or\u2014give\u2014me\u2014death.\"\nThe italicized part of the following might also be delivered with\nthis every-word emphasis. Of course, there are many ways of\ndelivering it; this is only one of several good interpretations\nthat might be chosen.\neffectively:\nKnowing the price we must pay, the sacrifice we must\nmake, the burdens we must carry, the assaults we must\nendure\u2014knowing full well the cost\u2014yet we enlist, and\nwe enlist for the war. For we know the justice of our\ncause, and we know, too, its certain triumph.\n\u2014From \"Pass Prosperity Around,\" by Albert J.\nBeveridge, before the Chicago National Convention of\nthe Progressive Party.\n22\nStrongly emphasizing a single word has a tendency to sug-\ngest its antithesis. Notice how the meaning changes by merely\nputting the emphasis on different words in the following sen-\ntence. The parenthetical expressions would really not be\nneeded to supplement the emphatic words.\nI intended to buy a house this Spring (even if you did\nnot).\nI INTENDED to buy a house this Spring (but something\nprevented).\nI intended to BUY a house this Spring (instead of renting\nas heretofore).\nI intended to buy a HOUSE this Spring (and not an\nautomobile).\nI intended to buy a house THIS Spring (instead of next\nSpring).\nI intended to buy a house this SPRING (instead of in the\nAutumn).\nWhen a great battle is reported in the papers, they do not\nkeep emphasizing the same facts over and over again. They try\nto get new information, or a \"new slant.\" The news that takes\nan important place in the morning edition will be relegated to a\nsmall space in the late afternoon edition. We are interested in\nnew ideas and new facts. This principle has a very important\nbearing in determining your emphasis. Do not emphasize the\nsame idea over and over again unless you desire to lay extra\nstress on it; Senator Thurston desired to put the maximum\namount of emphasis on \"force\" in his speech on page 50. Note\nhow force is emphasized repeatedly. As a general rule,\nhowever, the new idea, the \"new slant,\" whether in a newspa-\nper report of a battle or a speaker's enunciation of his ideas, is\nemphatic.\nIn the following selection, \"larger\" is emphatic, for it is the\nthis man asks for\nnew idea. All men have eyes, but\na LARGER eye.\nsafety\nThis man with the larger eye says he will discover, not rivers\nor\nbut NEW\nfor\nSTARS and SUNS. \"New stars and suns\" are hardly as emphat-\nic as the word \"larger.\" Why? Because we expect an\naeroplanes,\nappliances\n23\nastronomer to discover heavenly bodies rather than cooking re-\ncipes. The words, \"Republic needs\" in the next sentence, are\nemphatic; they introduce a new and important idea. Republics\nthey\nhave always needed men, but\nneed NEW men. \"New\" is emphatic because it introduces a\nnew idea. In like manner, \"soil,\" \"grain,\" \"tools,\" are also\nemphatic.\nthe author\nsays\nThe most emphatic words are italicized in this selection. Are\nthere any others you would emphasize? Why?\nThe old astronomer said, \"Give me a larger eye, and I\nwill discover new stars and suns.\" That is what therepub-\nlic needs today\u2014new men\u2014men who are wise toward\nthe soil, toward the grains, toward the tools. If God\nwould only raise up for the people two or three men\nlike Watt, Fulton and McCormick, they would beworth\nmore to the State than that treasure\nbox named California or Mexico. And the real suprem-\nacy of man is based upon his capacity for education. Man\nis unique in the length of his childhood, which means\nthe periodof plasticity and education. The childhood of\na moth, the distance that stands between the hatching of\nthe robinand its maturity, represent a few hours or a few\nweeks, but twenty years for growth stands\nbetween man'scradle and his citizenship. This protracted\nchildhood makes it possible to hand over to the boy all\ntheaccumulated stores\nachieved by races and civiliza-\ntions through thousands of years.\n\u2014Anonymous.\nYou must understand that there are no steel-riveted rules of\nemphasis. It is not always possible to designate which word\nmust, and which must not be emphasized. One speaker will put\none interpretation on a speech, another speaker will use differ-\nent emphasis to bring out a different interpretation. No one\ncan say that one interpretation is right and the other wrong.\nThis principle must be borne in mind in all our marked exer-\ncises. Here your own intelligence must guide\u2014and greatly to\nyour profit.\n24\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. What is emphasis?\n2. Describe one method of destroying monotony of thought-\npresentation.\n3. What relation does this have to the use of the voice?\n4. Which words should be emphasized, which subordinated,\nin a sentence?\n5. Read the selections on pages 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54, devot-\ning special attention to emphasizing the important words or\nphrases and subordinating the unimportant ones. Read again,\nchanging emphasis slightly. What is the effect?\n6. Read some sentence repeatedly, emphasizing a different\nword each time, and show how the meaning is changed, as is\ndone on page 22.\n7. What is the effect of a lack of emphasis?\n8. Read the selections on pages 30 and 48, emphasizing\nevery word. What is the effect on the emphasis?\n9. When is it permissible to emphasize every single word in a\nsentence?\n10. Note the emphasis and subordination in some conversa-\ntion or speech you have heard. Were they well made? Why?\nCan you suggest any improvement?\n11. From a newspaper or a magazine, clip a report of an ad-\ndress, or a biographical eulogy. Mark the passage for emphasis\nand bring it with you to class.\n12. In the following passage, would you make any changes in\nthe author's markings for emphasis? Where? Why? Bear in\nmind that not all words marked require the same degree of em-\nphasis\u2014in a wide variety of emphasis, and in nice shading of\nthe gradations, lie the excellence of emphatic speech.\nI would call him Napoleon, but Napoleon made his way\nto empire over broken oaths and through a sea ofblood.\nThis man never broke his word. \"No Retaliation\" was his\ngreat motto and the rule of his life; and the last words\nuttered to his son in France were these: \"My boy, you\nwill one day go back to Santo\nDomingo; forget thatFrance murdered your father.\" I\n25\nwould call him Cromwell, but Cromwell\nwas only a soldier, and the state he founded went\ndown with him into his grave. I would call\nhim Washington, but the great Virginian held slaves.\nThis man risked his empire rather than permit the slave-\ntrade in the humblest village of his dominions.\nYou think me a fanatic to-night, for you read his-\ntory, not with your eyes, but with your prejudices. But\nfifty years hence, when Truth gets a hearing, the Muse\nof History will put Phocion for the Greek, and Brutus for\ntheRoman, Hampden for England, Lafayette for France,\nchoose Washington as the bright, consummate flower of\nour earlier civilization, and John Brown the ripe fruit of\nour noonday, then, dipping her pen in the sunlight, will\nwrite in the clear blue, above them all, the name of\nthe soldier, the statesman, the martyr, TOUSSAINT\nL'OUVERTURE.\n\u2014Wendell Phillips, Toussaint l'Ouverture.\nPractise on the following selections for emphasis: Beecher's\n\"Abraham Lincoln,\" page 76; Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Speech,\"\npage 50; Seward's \"Irrepressible Conflict,\" page 67; and\nBryan's \"Prince of Peace,\" page 448.\n26\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 3\nEFFICIENCY THROUGH EMPHASIS AND\nSUBORDINATION\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Speech is simply a modified form of singing: the princip-\nal difference being in the fact that in singing the vowel\nsounds are prolonged and the intervals are short, where-\nas in speech the words are uttered in what may be called\n\"staccato\" tones, the vowels not being specially pro-\nlonged and the intervals between the words being more\ndistinct. The fact that in singing we have a larger range\nof tones does not properly distinguish it from ordinary\nspeech. In speech we have likewise a variation of tones,\nand even in ordinary conversation there is a difference\nof from three to six semi-tones, as I have found in my in-\nvestigations, and in some persons the range is as high as\none octave.\u2014William Scheppegrell, Popular Science\nMonthly.\nBy pitch, as everyone knows, we mean the relative position of\na vocal tone\u2014as, high, medium, low, or any variation between.\nIn public speech we apply it not only to a single utterance, as\nan exclamation or a monosyllable (Oh! or the) but to any group\nof syllables, words, and even sentences that may be spoken in\na single tone. This distinction it is important to keep in mind,\nfor the efficient speaker not only changes the pitch of success-\nive syllables (see Chapter VII, \"Efficiency through Inflection\"),\nbut gives a different pitch to different parts, or word-groups, of\nsuccessive sentences. It is this phase of the subject which we\nare considering in this chapter.\nEvery Change in the Thought Demands a Change in the\nVoice-Pitch\nWhether the speaker follows the rule consciously, uncon-\nsciously, or subconsciously, this is the logical basis upon which\nall good voice variation is made, yet this law is violated more\n27\noften than any other by public speakers. A criminal may disreg-\nard a law of the state without detection and punishment, but\nthe speaker who violates this regulation suffers its penalty at\nonce in his loss of effectiveness, while his innocent hearers\nmust endure the monotony\u2014for monotony is not only a sin of\nthe perpetrator, as we have shown, but a plague on the victims\nas well.\nChange of pitch is a stumbling block for almost all beginners,\nand for many experienced speakers also. This is especially true\nwhen the words of the speech have been memorized.\nIf you wish to hear how pitch-monotony sounds, strike the\nsame note on the piano over and over again. You have in your\nspeaking voice a range of pitch from high to low, with a great\nmany shades between the extremes. With all these notes avail-\nable there is no excuse for offending the ears and taste of your\naudience by continually using the one note. True, the reitera-\ntion of the same tone in music\u2014as in pedal point on an organ\ncomposition\u2014may be made the foundation of beauty, for the\nharmony weaving about that one basic tone produces a consist-\ninsistent quality not felt in pure variety of chord se-\nent,\nquences.\nIn like manner the intoning voice in a ritual\nmay\u2014though it rarely does\u2014possess a solemn beauty. But the\npublic speaker should shun the monotone as he would a\npestilence.\nContinual Change of Pitch is Nature's Highest Method\nIn our search for the principles of efficiency we must con-\ntinually go back to nature. Listen\u2014really listen\u2014to the birds\nsing. Which of these feathered tribes are most pleasing in their\nvocal efforts: those whose voices, though sweet, have little or\nno range, or those that, like the canary, the lark, and the night-\ningale, not only possess a considerable range but utter their\nnotes in continual variety of combinations? Even a sweet-toned\nchirp, when reiterated without change, may grow maddening\nto the enforced listener.\nThe little child seldom speaks in a monotonous pitch. Ob-\nserve the conversations of little folk that you hear on the street\nor in the home, and note the continual changes of pitch. The\nunconscious speech of most adults is likewise full of pleasing\nvariations.\n28\nImagine someone speaking the following, and consider if the\neffect would not be just about as indicated. Remember, we are\nnot now discussing the inflection of single words, but the gen-\neral pitch in which phrases are spoken.\n(High pitch) \"I'd like to leave for my vacation tomor-\nrow,\u2014(lower) still, I have so much to do. (Higher) Yet I suppose\nif I wait until I have time I'll never go.\"\nRepeat this, first in the pitches indicated, and then all in the\none pitch, as many speakers would. Observe the difference in\nnaturalness of effect.\nThe following exercise should be spoken in a purely conver-\nsational tone, with numerous changes of pitch. Practise it until\nyour delivery would cause a stranger in the next room to think\nyou were discussing an actual incident with a friend, instead of\ndelivering a memorized monologue. If you are in doubt about\nthe effect you have secured, repeat it to a friend and ask him if\nit sounds like memorized words. If it does, it is wrong.\nA SIMILAR CASE\nJack, I hear you've gone and done it.\u2014Yes, I know; most\nfellows will; went and tried it once myself, sir, though\nyou see I'm single still. And you met her\u2014did you tell\nme\u2014down at Newport, last July, and resolved to ask the\nquestion at a soir\u00e9e? So did I.\nI suppose you left the ball-room, with its music and its\nlight; for they say love's flame is brightest in the dark-\nness of the night. Well, you walked along together, over-\nhead the starlit sky; and I'll bet\u2014old man, confess\nit\u2014you were frightened. So was I.\nSo you strolled along the terrace, saw the summer moon-\nlight pour all its radiance on the waters, as they rippled\non the shore, till at length you gathered courage, when\nyou saw that none was nigh\u2014did you draw her close and\ntell her that you loved her? So did I.\nWell, I needn't ask you further, and I'm sure I wish you\njoy. Think I'll wander down and see you when you're\nmarried\u2014eh, my boy? When the honeymoon is over and\nyou're settled down, we'll try\u2014What? the deuce you say!\nRejected\u2014you rejected? So was I.\u2014Anonymous.\n29\nThe necessity for changing pitch is so self-evident that it\nshould be grasped and applied immediately. However, it re-\nquires patient drill to free yourself from monotony of pitch.\nIn natural conversation you think of an idea first, and then\nfind words to express it. In memorized speeches you are liable\nto speak the words, and then think what they mean\u2014and many\nspeakers seem to trouble very little even about that. Is it any\nwonder that reversing the process should reverse the result?\nGet back to nature in your methods of expression.\nRead the following selection in a nonchalant manner, never\npausing to think what the words really mean. Try it again,\ncarefully studying the thought you have assimilated. Believe\nthe idea, desire to express it effectively, and imagine an audi-\nence before you. Look them earnestly in the face and repeat\nthis truth. If you follow directions, you will note that you have\nmade many changes of pitch after several readings.\nIt is not work that kills men; it is worry. Work is healthy; you\ncan hardly put more upon a man than he can bear. Worry is\nrust upon the blade. It is not the revolution that destroys the\nmachinery but the friction.\u2014Henry Ward Beecher.\nChange of Pitch Produces Emphasis\nThis is a highly important statement. Variety in pitch main-\ntains the hearer's interest, but one of the surest ways to com-\npel attention\u2014to secure unusual emphasis\u2014is to change the\npitch of your voice suddenly and in a marked degree. A great\ncontrast always arouses attention. White shows whiter against\nblack; a cannon roars louder in the Sahara silence than in the\nChicago hurly burly\u2014these are simple illustrations of the\npower of contrast.\n\"What is Congress going to do\nnext?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(High pitch)\n|\n| I do not know.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(Low pitch)\nBy such sudden change of pitch during a sermon Dr. Newell\nDwight Hillis recently achieved great emphasis and suggested\nthe gravity of the question he had raised.\n30\nThe foregoing order of pitch-change might be reversed with\nequally good effect, though with a slight change in serious-\nness\u2014either method produces emphasis when used intelli-\ngently, that is, with a common-sense appreciation of the sort of\nemphasis to be attained.\nIn attempting these contrasts of pitch it is important to avoid\nunpleasant extremes. Most speakers pitch their voices too\nhigh. One of the secrets of Mr. Bryan's eloquence is his low,\nbell-like voice. Shakespeare said that a soft, gentle, low voice\nwas \"an excellent thing in woman;\" it is no less so in man, for a\nvoice need not be blatant to be powerful,\u2014and must not be, to\nbe pleasing.\nIn closing, let us emphasize anew the importance of using\nvariety of pitch. You sing up and down the scale, first touching\none note and then another above or below it. Do likewise in\nspeaking.\nThought and individual taste must generally be your guide as\nto where to use a low, a moderate, or a high pitch.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Name two methods of destroying monotony and gaining\nforce in speaking.\n2. Why is a continual change of pitch necessary in speaking?\n3. Notice your habitual tones in speaking. Are they too high\nto be pleasant?\n4. Do we express the following thoughts and emotions in a\nlow or a high pitch? Which may be expressed in either high or\nlow pitch? Excitement. Victory. Defeat. Sorrow. Love. Earnest-\nness. Fear.\n5. How would you naturally vary the pitch in introducing an\nexplanatory or parenthetical expression like the following:\nHe started\u2014that is, he made preparations to start\u2014on\nSeptember third.\n6. Speak the following lines with as marked variations in\npitch as your interpretation of the sense may dictate. Try each\nline in two different ways. Which, in each instance, is the more\neffective\u2014and why?\n31\nWhat have I to gain from you? Nothing.\nTo engage our nation in such a compact would be an\ninfamy.\nNote: In the foregoing sentence, experiment as to where\nthe change in pitch would better be made.\nOnce the flowers distilled their fragrance here, but now\nsee the devastations of war.\nHe had reckoned without one prime factor\u2014his\nconscience.\n7. Make a diagram of a conversation you have heard, show-\ning where high and low pitches were used. Were these changes\nin pitch advisable? Why or why not?\n8. Read the selections on pages 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38, paying\ncareful attention to the changes in pitch. Reread, substituting\nlow pitch for high, and vice versa.\nSelections for Practise\nNote: In the following selections, those passages that may\nbest be delivered in a moderate pitch are printed in ordinary\n(roman)\ntype. Those which may be rendered in a high\npitch\u2014do not make the mistake of raising the voice too\nhigh\u2014are printed in italics. Those which might well be spoken\nin a low pitch are printed in CAPITALS.\nThese arrangements, however, are merely suggestive\u2014we\ncannot make it strong enough that you must use your own\njudgment in interpreting a selection. Before doing so, however,\nit is well to practise these passages as they are marked.\nYes, all men labor. RUFUS CHOATE AND DANIEL\nWEBSTER labor, say the critics. But every man who\nreads of the labor question knows that it means the\nmovement of the men that earn their living with their\nhands;THAT ARE EMPLOYED, AND PAID WAGES: are\ngathered under roofs of factories, sent out on farms, sent\nout on ships, gathered on the walls. In popular accepta-\ntion, the working class means the men that work with\ntheir hands, for wages, so many hours a day, employed\nby great capitalists; that work for everybody else. Why\ndo we move for this class? \"Why,\" asks a critic, \"don't\nyou move FOR ALL WORKINGMEN?\" BECAUSE, WHILE\n32\nDANIEL WEBSTER GETS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS\nFOR ARGUING THE MEXICAN CLAIMS, there is no\nneed of anybody's moving for him. BECAUSE, WHILE\nRUFUS CHOATE GETS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS\nFOR MAKING ONE ARGUMENT TO A JURY, there is no\nneed of moving for him, or for the men that work with\ntheir brains,\u2014that do highly disciplined and skilled\nlabor, invent, and write books. The reason why the Labor\nmovement confines itself to a single class is because that\nclass of work DOES NOT GET PAID, does not get protec-\ntion. MENTAL LABOR is adequately paid, and MORE\nTHAN ADEQUATELY protected. IT CAN SHIFT ITS\nCHANNELS; it can vary according to the supply and\ndemand.\nIF A MAN FAILS AS A MINISTER, why, he becomes a\nrailway conductor. IF THAT DOESN'T SUIT HIM, he\ngoes West, and becomes governor of a territory. AND IF\nHE FINDS HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF EITHER OF\nTHESE POSITIONS, he comes home, and gets to be a\ncity editor. He varies his occupation as he pleases, and\ndoesn't need protection. BUT THE GREAT MASS,\nCHAINED TO A TRADE, DOOMED TO BE GROUND UP\nIN THE MILL OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND, THAT WORK\nSO MANY HOURS A DAY, AND MUST RUN IN THE\nGREAT RUTS OF BUSINESS,\u2014they are the men whose\ninadequate protection, whose unfair share of the general\nproduct, claims a movement in their behalf.\n\u2014Wendell Phillips.\nKNOWING THE PRICE WE MUST PAY, THE SACRIFICE\nWE MUST MAKE, THE BURDENS WE MUST CARRY,\nTHE ASSAULTS WE MUST ENDURE\u2014KNOWING FULL\nWELL THE COST\u2014yet we enlist, and we enlist for the\nwar. FOR WE KNOW THE JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE,\nand we know, too, its certain triumph.\nNOT RELUCTANTLY THEN, but eagerly, not with faint\nhearts BUT STRONG, do we now advance upon the en-\nemies of the people.

Beveridge.\nRemember that two sentences, or two parts of the same sen-\ntence, which contain changes of thought, cannot possibly be\ngiven effectively in the same key. Let us repeat, every big\nchange of thought requires a big change of pitch. What the be-\nginning student will think are big changes of pitch will be\nmonotonously alike. Learn to speak some thoughts in a very\nhigh tone\u2014others in a very, verylow tone. DEVELOP RANGE.

Our guns that fire six\nhundred times a minute, shoot at a fast tempo; the old muzzle\nloader that required three minutes to load, shot at a slow\ntempo. Every musician understands this principle: it requires\nlonger to sing a half note than it does an eighth note.\nNow tempo is a tremendously important element in good\nplatform work, for when a speaker delivers a whole address at\nvery nearly the same rate of speed he is depriving himself of\none of his chief means of emphasis and power. The baseball\npitcher, the bowler in cricket, the tennis server, all know the\nvalue of change of pace\u2014change of tempo\u2014in delivering their\nball, and so must the public speaker observe its power.\nChange of Tempo Lends Naturalness to the Delivery\nNaturalness, or at least seeming naturalness, as was ex-\nplained in the chapter on \"Monotony,\" is greatly to be desired,\nand a continual change of tempo will go a long way towards\n38\nestablishing it. Mr. Howard Lindsay, Stage Manager for Miss\nMargaret Anglin, recently said to the present writer that\nchange of pace was one of the most effective tools of the actor.\nWhile it must be admitted that the stilted mouthings of many\nactors indicate cloudy mirrors, still the public speaker would\ndo well to study the actor's use of tempo.\nThere is, however, a more fundamental and effective source\nat which to study naturalness\u2014a trait which, once lost, is shy\nof recapture: that source is the common conversation of any\nwell-bred circle. This is the standard we strive to reach on both\nstage and platform\u2014with certain differences, of course, which\nwill appear as we go on. If speaker and actor were to repro-\nduce with absolute fidelity every variation of utterance\u2014every\nwhisper, grunt, pause, silence, and explosion\u2014of conversation\nas we find it typically in everyday life, much of the interest\nwould leave the public utterance. Naturalness in public ad-\ndress\nreproduction of\nnature\u2014it is the reproduction of those typical parts of nature's\nwork which are truly representative of the whole.\nsomething more than faithful\nis\nThe realistic story-writer understands this in writing dia-\nlogue, and we must take it into account in seeking for natural-\nness through change of tempo.\nSuppose you speak the first of the following sentences in a\nslow tempo, the second quickly, observing how natural is the\neffect. Then speak both with the same rapidity and note the\ndifference.\nI can't recall what I did with my knife. Oh, now I remember I\ngave it to Mary.\nWe see here that a change of tempo often occurs in the same\nsentence\u2014for tempo applies not only to single words, groups of\nwords, and groups of sentences, but to the major parts of a\npublic speech as well.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

Beveridge.\nChange of Tempo Produces Emphasis\nAny big change of tempo is emphatic and will catch the at-\ntention. You may scarcely be conscious that a passenger train\nis moving when it is flying over the rails at ninety miles an\nhour, but if it slows down very suddenly to a ten-mile gait your\nattention will be drawn to it very decidedly. You may forget\nthat you are listening to music as you dine, but let the orches-\ntra either increase or diminish its tempo in a very marked de-\ngree and your attention will be arrested at once.\nThis same principle will procure emphasis in a speech. If you\nhave a point that you want to bring home to your audience\nforcefully, make a sudden and great change of tempo, and they\nwill be powerless to keep from paying attention to that point.\nRecently the present writer saw a play in which these lines\nwere spoken:\n45\n\"I don't want you to forget what I said. I want you to remem-\nber it the longest day you\u2014I don't care if you've got six guns.\"\nThe part up to the dash was delivered in a very slow tempo, the\nremainder was named out at lightning speed, as the character\nwho was spoken to drew a revolver. The effect was so emphat-\nic that the lines are remembered six months afterwards, while\nmost of the play has faded from memory. The student who has\npowers of observation will see this principle applied by all our\nbest actors in their efforts to get emphasis where emphasis is\ndue. But remember that the emotion in the matter must war-\nrant the intensity in the manner, or the effect will be ridicu-\nlous. Too many public speakers are impressive over nothing.\nThought rather than rules must govern you while practising\nchange of pace.

This is a common fault with amateur speakers.\nMrs. Siddons rule was, \"Take time.\" A hundred years ago there\nwas used in medical circles a preparation known as \"the shot\ngun remedy;\" it was a mixture of about fifty different ingredi-\nents, and was given to the patient in the hope that at least one\nof them would prove efficacious!

Now we are engaged in a great civil war,\ntesting whether that nation\u2014or any nation so conceived\nand so dedicated\u2014can long endure.\nWe are met on a great battlefield of that war. We are\nmet to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting-place\nof those who have given their lives that that nation might\nlive. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do\nthis.\nBut, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot\nconsecrate, we cannot hallow, this ground. The brave\nmen, living and dead, who struggled here, have consec-\nrated it, far above our power to add or to detract. The\nworld will very little note nor long remember what we\nsay here; but it can never forget what they did here.\nIt is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the\nunfinished work they have thus far so nobly carried on.\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task\nremaining before us: that from these honored dead we\ntake increased devotion to that cause for which they\nhere gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here\nhighly resolve that these dead shall not have died in\nvain; that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth\nof freedom, and that government of the people, by the\npeople, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n\u2014Abraham Lincoln.\nA PLEA FOR CUBA\n[This deliberative oration was delivered by Senator Thurston in the\nUnited States Senate on March 24, 1898. It is recorded in full in\nthe Congressional Record of that date. Mrs. Thurston died in Cuba.\nAs a dying request she urged her husband, who was investigating af-\nfairs in the island, to do his utmost to induce the United States to in-\ntervene\u2014hence this oration.]\nMr. President, I am here by command of silent lips to\nspeak once and for all upon the Cuban situation. I shall\nendeavor to be honest, conservative, and just. I have no\npurpose to stir the public passion to any action not ne-\ncessary and imperative to meet the duties and necessit-\nies of American responsibility, Christian humanity, and\nnational honor. I would shirk this task if I could, but I\n48\ndare not. I cannot satisfy my conscience except by\nspeaking, and speaking now.\nI went to Cuba firmly believing that the condition of af-\nfairs there had been greatly exaggerated by the press,\nand my own efforts were directed in the first instance to\nthe attempted exposure of these supposed exaggera-\ntions. There has undoubtedly been much sensationalism\nin the journalism of the time, but as to the condition of\naffairs in Cuba, there has been no exaggeration, because\nexaggeration has been impossible.\nUnder the inhuman policy of Weyler not less than four\nhundred thousand self-supporting, simple, peaceable,\ndefenseless country people were driven from their\nhomes in the agricultural portions of the Spanish\nprovinces to the cities, and imprisoned upon the barren\nwaste outside the residence portions of these cities and\nwithin the lines of intrenchment established a little way\nbeyond. Their humble homes were burned, their fields\nlaid waste, their implements of husbandry destroyed,\ntheir live stock and food supplies for the most part con-\nfiscated. Most of the people were old men, women, and\nchildren. They were thus placed in hopeless imprison-\nment, without shelter or food. There was no work for\nthem in the cities to which they were driven. They were\nleft with nothing to depend upon except the scanty char-\nity of the inhabitants of the cities and with slow starva-\ntion their inevitable fate\u2026 .\nThe pictures in the American newspapers of the starving\nreconcentrados are true. They can all be duplicated by\nthe thousands. I never before saw, and please God I may\nnever again see, so deplorable a sight as the recon-\ncentrados in the suburbs of Matanzas. I can never forget\nto my dying day the hopeless anguish in their despairing\neyes. Huddled about their little bark huts, they raised no\nvoice of appeal to us for alms as we went among them\u2026\n.\nMen, women, and children stand silent, famishing with\nhunger. Their only appeal comes from their sad eyes,\nthrough which one looks as through an open window in-\nto their agonizing souls.\n49\nThe government of Spain has not appropriated and will\nnot appropriate one dollar to save these people. They are\nnow being attended and nursed and administered to by\nthe charity of the United States. Think of the spectacle!\nWe are feeding these citizens of Spain; we are nursing\ntheir sick; we are saving such as can be saved, and yet\nthere are those who still say it is right for us to send\nfood, but we must keep hands off. I say that the time has\ncome when muskets ought to go with the food.\nWe asked the governor if he knew of any relief for these\npeople except through the charity of the United States.\nHe did not. We asked him, \"When do you think the time\nwill come that these people can be placed in a position of\nself-support?\" He replied to us, with deep feeling, \"Only\nthe good God or the great government of the United\nStates will answer that question.\" I hope and believe that\nthe good God by the great government of the United\nStates will answer that question.\nI shall refer to these horrible things no further. They are\nthere. God pity me, I have seen them; they will remain in\nmy mind forever\u2014and this is almost the twentieth cen-\ntury. Christ died nineteen hundred years ago, and Spain\nis a Christian nation. She has set up more crosses in\nmore lands, beneath more skies, and under them has\nbutchered more people than all the other nations of the\nearth combined. Europe may tolerate her existence as\nlong as the people of the Old World wish. God grant that\nbefore another Christmas morning the last vestige of\nSpanish tyranny and oppression will have vanished from\nthe Western Hemisphere!\u2026\nThe time for action has come. No greater reason for it\ncan exist to-morrow than exists to-day. Every hour's\ndelay only adds another chapter to the awful story of\nmisery and death. Only one power can intervene\u2014the\nUnited States of America. Ours is the one great nation in\nthe world, the mother of American republics. She holds a\nposition of trust and responsibility toward the peoples\nand affairs of the whole Western Hemisphere. It was her\nglorious example which inspired the patriots of Cuba to\nraise the flag of liberty in her eternal hills. We cannot\n50\nrefuse to accept this responsibility which the God of the\nuniverse has placed upon us as the one great power in\nthe New World. We must act! What shall our action be?\nAgainst the intervention of the United States in this holy\ncause there is but one voice of dissent; that voice is the\nvoice of the money-changers. They fear war! Not be-\ncause of any Christian or ennobling sentiment against\nwar and in favor of peace, but because they fear that a\ndeclaration of war, or the intervention which might res-\nult in war, would have a depressing effect upon the stock\nmarket. Let them go. They do not represent American\nsentiment; they do not represent American patriotism.\nLet them take their chances as they can. Their weal or\nwoe is of but little importance to the liberty-loving\npeople of the United States. They will not do the fight-\ning; their blood will not flow; they will keep on dealing in\noptions on human life. Let the men whose loyalty is to\nthe dollar stand aside while the men whose loyalty is to\nthe flag come to the front.\nMr. President, there is only one action possible, if any is\ntaken; that is, intervention for the independence of the\nisland. But we cannot intervene and save Cuba without\nthe exercise of force, and force means war; war means\nblood. The lowly Nazarene on the shores of Galilee\npreached the divine doctrine of love, \"Peace on earth,\ngood will toward men.\" Not peace on earth at the ex-\npense of liberty and humanity. Not good will toward men\nwho despoil, enslave, degrade, and starve to death their\nfellow-men. I believe in the doctrine of Christ. I believe\nin the doctrine of peace; but, Mr. President, men must\nhave liberty before there can come abiding peace.\nIntervention means force. Force means war. War means\nblood. But it will be God's force. When has a battle for\nhumanity and liberty ever been won except by force?\nWhat barricade of wrong, injustice, and oppression has\never been carried except by force?\nForce compelled the signature of unwilling royalty to the\ngreat Magna Charta; force put life into the Declaration\nof Independence and made effective the Emancipation\nProclamation; force beat with naked hands upon the iron\n51\ngateway of the Bastile and made reprisal in one awful\nhour for centuries of kingly crime; force waved the flag\nof revolution over Bunker Hill and marked the snows of\nValley Forge with blood-stained feet; force held the\nbroken line of Shiloh, climbed the flame-swept hill at\nChattanooga, and stormed the clouds on Lookout\nHeights; force marched with Sherman to the sea, rode\nwith Sheridan in the valley of the Shenandoah, and gave\nGrant victory at Appomattox; force saved the Union, kept\nthe stars in the flag, made \"niggers\" men. The time for\nGod's force has come again.

It is con-\nceivable that a speaker may be effective in spite of stum-\nbling\u2014but never because of it.\nOn the other hand, one of the most important means of de-\nveloping power in public speaking is to pause either before or\nafter, or both before and after, an important word or phrase.\nNo one who would be a forceful speaker can afford to neglect\nthis principle\u2014one of the most significant that has ever been\n53\ninferred from listening to great orators. Study this potential\ndevice until you have absorbed and assimilated it.\nIt would seem that this principle of rhetorical pause ought to\nbe easily grasped and applied, but a long experience in train-\ning both college men and maturer speakers has demonstrated\nthat the device is no more readily understood by the average\nman when it is first explained to him than if it were spoken in\nHindoostani. Perhaps this is because we do not eagerly devour\nthe fruit of experience when it is impressively set before us on\nthe platter of authority; we like to pluck fruit for ourselves\u2014it\nnot only tastes better, but we never forget that tree! For-\ntunately, this is no difficult task, in this instance, for the trees\nstand thick all about us.\nOne man is pleading the cause of another:\n\"This man, my friends, has made this wonderful sacrifice\u2014for\nyou and me.\"\nDid not the pause surprisingly enhance the power of this\nstatement? See how he gathered up reserve force and impress-\niveness to deliver the words \"for you and me.\" Repeat this pas-\nsage without making a pause. Did it lose in effectiveness?\nNaturally enough, during a premeditated pause of this kind\nthe mind of the speaker is concentrated on the thought to\nwhich he is about to give expression. He will not dare to allow\nhis thoughts to wander for an instant\u2014he will rather supremely\ncenter his thought and his emotion upon the sacrifice whose\nservice, sweetness and divinity he is enforcing by his appeal.\nConcentration, then, is the big word here\u2014no pause without\nit can perfectly hit the mark.\nEfficient pausing accomplishes one or all of four results:\n1. Pause Enables the Mind of the Speaker to Gather His\nForces Before Delivering the Final Volley\nIt is often dangerous to rush into battle without pausing for\npreparation or waiting for recruits. Consider Custer's massacre\nas an instance.\nYou can light a match by holding it beneath a lens and con-\ncentrating the sun's rays. You would not expect the match to\nflame if you jerked the lens back and forth quickly. Pause, and\nthe lens gathers the heat. Your thoughts will not set fire to the\nminds of your hearers unless you pause to gather the force that\ncomes by a second or two of concentration. Maple trees and\n54\ngas wells are rarely tapped continually; when a stronger flow is\nwanted, a pause is made, nature has time to gather her reserve\nforces, and when the tree or the well is reopened, a stronger\nflow is the result.\nUse the same common sense with your mind. If you would\nmake a thought particularly effective, pause just before its ut-\nterance, concentrate your mind-energies, and then give it ex-\npression with renewed vigor. Carlyle was right: \"Speak not, I\npassionately entreat thee, till thy thought has silently matured\nitself. Out of silence comes thy strength. Speech is silvern, Si-\nlence is golden; Speech is human, Silence is divine.\"\nSilence has been called the father of speech. It should be.\nToo many of our public speeches have no fathers. They ramble\nalong without pause or break. Like Tennyson's brook, they run\non forever. Listen to little children, the policeman on the\ncorner, the family conversation around the table, and see how\nmany pauses they naturally use, for they are unconscious of ef-\nfects. When we get before an audience, we throw most of our\nnatural methods of expression to the wind, and strive after arti-\nficial effects. Get back to the methods of nature\u2014and pause.\n2. Pause Prepares the Mind of the Auditor to Receive Your\nMessage\nHerbert Spencer said that all the universe is in motion. So it\nis\u2014and all perfect motion is rhythm. Part of rhythm is rest.\nRest follows activity all through nature. Instances: day and\nnight; spring\u2014summer\u2014autumn\u2014winter; a period of rest\nbetween breaths; an instant of complete rest between heart\nbeats. Pause, and give the attention-powers of your audience a\nrest. What you say after such a silence will then have a great\ndeal more effect.\nWhen your country cousins come to town, the noise of a\npassing car will awaken them, though it seldom affects a\nseasoned city dweller. By the continual passing of cars his\nattention-power has become deadened. In one who visits the\ncity but seldom, attention-value is insistent. To him the noise\ncomes after a long pause; hence its power. To you, dweller in\nthe city, there is no pause; hence the low attention-value. After\nriding on a train several hours you will become so accustomed\nto its roar that it will lose its attention-value, unless the train\nshould stop for a while and start again. If you attempt to listen\n55\nto a clock-tick that is so far away that you can barely hear it,\nyou will find that at times you are unable to distinguish it, but\nin a few moments the sound becomes distinct again. Your mind\nwill pause for rest whether you desire it to do so or not.\nThe attention of your audience will act in quite the same\nway. Recognize this law and prepare for it\u2014by pausing. Let it\nbe repeated: the thought that follows a pause is much more dy-\nnamic than if no pause had occurred. What is said to you of a\nnight will not have the same effect on your mind as if it had\nbeen uttered in the morning when your attention had been\nlately refreshed by the pause of sleep. We are told on the first\npage of the Bible that even the Creative Energy of God rested\non the \"seventh day.\" You may be sure, then, that the frail fi-\nnite mind of your audience will likewise demand rest. Observe\nnature, study her laws, and obey them in your speaking.\n3. Pause Creates Effective Suspense\nSuspense is responsible for a great share of our interest in\nlife; it will be the same with your speech. A play or a novel is\noften robbed of much of its interest if you know the plot before-\nhand. We like to keep guessing as to the outcome. The ability\nto create suspense is part of woman's power to hold the other\nsex. The circus acrobat employs this principle when he fails\npurposely in several attempts to perform a feat, and then\nachieves it. Even the deliberate manner in which he arranges\nthe preliminaries increases our expectation\u2014we like to be kept\nwaiting. In the last act of the play, \"Polly of the Circus,\" there\nis a circus scene in which a little dog turns a backward somer-\nsault on the back of a running pony. One night when he hesit-\nated and had to be coaxed and worked with a long time before\nhe would perform his feat he got a great deal more applause\nthan when he did his trick at once. We not only like to wait but\nwe appreciate what we wait for. If fish bite too readily the\nsport soon ceases to be a sport.\nIt is this same principle of suspense that holds you in a Sher-\nlock Holmes story\u2014you wait to see how the mystery is solved,\nand if it is solved too soon you throw down the tale unfinished.\nWilkie Collins' receipt for fiction writing well applies to public\nspeech: \"Make 'em laugh; make 'em weep; make 'em wait.\"\nAbove all else make them wait; if they will not do that you may\nbe sure they will neither laugh nor weep.\n56\nThus pause is a valuable instrument in the hands of a trained\nspeaker to arouse and maintain suspense. We once heard Mr.\nBryan say in a speech: \"It was my privilege to hear\"\u2014and he\npaused, while the audience wondered for a second whom it\nwas his privilege to hear\u2014\"the great evangelist\"\u2014and he\npaused again; we knew a little more about the man he had\nheard, but still wondered to which evangelist he referred; and\nthen he concluded: \"Dwight L. Moody.\" Mr. Bryan paused\nslightly again and continued: \"I came to regard him\"\u2014here he\npaused again and held the audience in a brief moment of sus-\npense as to how he had regarded Mr. Moody, then contin-\nued\u2014\"as the greatest preacher of his day.\" Let the dashes illus-\ntrate pauses and we have the following:\n\"It was my privilege to hear\u2014the great evangel-\nist\u2014Dwight L. Moody.\u2014I came to regard him\u2014as the\ngreatest preacher of his day.\"\nThe unskilled speaker would have rattled this off with neither\npause nor suspense, and the sentences would have fallen flat\nupon the audience. It is precisely the application of these small\nthings that makes much of the difference between the success-\nful and the unsuccessful speaker.\n4. Pausing After An Important\nIdea Gives it Time to\nPenetrate\nAny Missouri farmer will tell you that a rain that falls too fast\nwill run off into the creeks and do the crops but little good. A\nstory is told of a country deacon praying for rain in this man-\nner: \"Lord, don't send us any chunk floater. Just give us a good\nold drizzle-drazzle.\" A speech, like a rain, will not do anybody\nmuch good if it comes too fast to soak in. The farmer's wife fol-\nlows this same principle in doing her washing when she puts\nthe clothes in water\u2014and pauses for several hours that the wa-\nter may soak in. The physician puts cocaine on your turbin-\nates\u2014and pauses to let it take hold before he removes them.\nWhy do we use this principle everywhere except in the commu-\nnication of ideas? If you have given the audience a big idea,\npause for a second or two and let them turn it over. See what\neffect it has. After the smoke clears away you may have to fire\nanother 14-inch shell on the same subject before you demolish\n57\nthe citadel of error that you are trying to destroy. Take time.\nDon't let your speech resemble those tourists who try \"to do\"\nNew York in a day. They spend fifteen minutes looking at the\nmasterpieces in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts, ten minutes\nin the Museum of Natural History, take a peep into the Aquari-\num, hurry across the Brooklyn Bridge, rush up to the Zoo, and\nback by Grant's Tomb\u2014and call that \"Seeing New York.\" If you\nhasten by your important points without pausing, your audi-\nence will have just about as adequate an idea of what you have\ntried to convey.\nTake time, you have just as much of it as our richest multi-\nmillionaire. Your audience will wait for you. It is a sign of\nsmallness to hurry. The great redwood trees of California had\nburst through the soil five hundred years before Socrates\ndrank his cup of hemlock poison, and are only in their prime\ntoday. Nature shames us with our petty haste. Silence is one of\nthe most eloquent things in the world. Master it, and use it\nthrough pause.\nIn the following selections dashes have been inserted where\npauses may be used effectively. Naturally, you may omit some\nof these and insert others without going wrong\u2014one speaker\nwould interpret a passage in one way, one in another; it is\nlargely a matter of personal preference. A dozen great actors\nhave played Hamlet well, and yet each has played the part dif-\nferently. Which comes the nearest to perfection is a question of\nopinion. You will succeed best by daring to follow your own\ncourse\u2014if you are individual enough to blaze an original trail.\nA moment's halt\u2014a momentary taste of being from the\nwell amid the waste\u2014and lo! the phantom caravan has\nreached\u2014the nothing it set out from\u2014Oh make haste!\nThe worldly hope men set their hearts upon\u2014turns\nashes\u2014or it prospers;\u2014and anon like snow upon the\ndesert's dusty face\u2014lighting a little hour or two\u2014is\ngone.\nThe bird of time has but a little way to flutter,\u2014and the\nbird is on the wing.\n58\nYou will note that the punctuation marks have nothing to do\nwith the pausing. You may run by a period very quickly and\nmake a long pause where there is no kind of punctuation.\nThought is greater than punctuation. It must guide you in your\npauses.\nA book of verses underneath the bough,\u2014a jug of wine, a\nloaf of bread\u2014and thou beside me singing in the wilder-\nness\u2014Oh\u2014wilderness were paradise enow.\nYou must not confuse the pause for emphasis with the natur-\nal pauses that come through taking breath and phrasing. For\nexample, note the pauses indicated in this selection from\nByron:\nBut hush!\u2014hark!\u2014that deep sound breaks in once more,\nAnd nearer!\u2014clearer!\u2014deadlier than before.\nArm, ARM!\u2014it is\u2014it is the cannon's opening roar!\nIt is not necessary to dwell at length upon these obvious dis-\ntinctions. You will observe that in natural conversation our\nwords are gathered into clusters or phrases, and we often\npause to take breath between them. So in public speech,\nbreathe naturally and do not talk until you must gasp for\nbreath; nor until the audience is equally winded.\nA serious word of caution must here be uttered: do not over-\nwork the pause. To do so will make your speech heavy and stil-\nted. And do not think that pause can transmute commonplace\nthoughts into great and dignified utterance. A grand manner\ncombined with insignificant ideas is like harnessing a Hamb-\nletonian with an ass. You remember the farcical old school de-\nclamation, \"A Midnight Murder,\" that proceeded in grandiose\nmanner to a thrilling climax, and ended\u2014\"and relentlessly\nmurdered\u2014a mosquito!\"\nThe pause, dramatically handled, always drew a laugh from\nthe tolerant hearers. This is all very well in farce, but such\nanti-climax becomes painful when the speaker falls from the\nsublime to the ridiculous quite unintentionally. The pause, to\nbe effective in some other manner than in that of the boomer-\nang, must precede or follow a thought that is really worth\n59\nwhile, or at least an idea whose bearing upon the rest of the\nspeech is important.\nWilliam Pittenger relates in his volume, \"Extempore Speech,\"\nan instance of the unconsciously farcical use of the pause by a\nreally great American statesman and orator. \"He had visited\nNiagara Falls and was to make an oration at Buffalo the same\nday, but, unfortunately, he sat too long over the wine after din-\nner. When he arose to speak, the oratorical instinct struggled\nwith difficulties, as he declared, 'Gentlemen, I have been to\nlook upon your mag\u2014mag\u2014magnificent cataract, one hun-\ndred\u2014and forty\u2014seven\u2014feet high! Gentlemen, Greece and\nRome in their palmiest days never had a cataract one hun-\ndred\u2014and forty\u2014seven\u2014feet high!'\"\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

Read aloud the following address, paying careful attention\nto pause wherever the emphasis may thereby be heightened.\nTHE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT\n\u2026 At last, the Republican party has appeared. It avows,\nnow, as the Republican party of 1800 did, in one word,\nits faith and its works, \"Equal and exact justice to all\nmen.\" Even when it first entered the field, only half or-\nganized, it struck a blow which only just failed to secure\ncomplete and triumphant victory. In this, its second cam-\npaign, it has already won advantages which render that\ntriumph now both easy and certain. The secret of its as-\nsured success lies in that very characteristic which, in\nthe mouth of scoffers, constitutes its great and lasting\nimbecility and reproach. It lies in the fact that it is a\nparty of one idea; but that is a noble one\u2014an idea that\nfills and expands all generous souls; the idea of equality\nof all men before human tribunals and human laws, as\nthey all are equal before the Divine tribunal and Divine\nlaws.\nI know, and you know, that a revolution has begun.

The expressiveness\nof language is literally multiplied by this subtle power to shade\nthe vocal tones, and this voice-shading we call inflection.\nThe change of pitch within a word is even more important,\nbecause more delicate, than the change of pitch from phrase to\nphrase. Indeed, one cannot be practised without the other. The\nbare words are only so many bricks\u2014inflection will make of\nthem a pavement, a garage, or a cathedral. It is the power of\ninflection to change the meaning of words that gave birth to\nthe old saying: \"It is not so much what you say, as how you say\nit.\"\nMrs. Jameson, the Shakespearean commentator, has given us\na penetrating example of the effect of inflection; \"In her imper-\nsonation of the part of Lady Macbeth, Mrs. Siddons adopted\nsuccessively three different intonations in giving the words 'We\nfail.' At first a quick contemptuous interrogation\u2014'We fail?'\nAfterwards, with the note of admiration\u2014'We fail,' an accent of\n65\nindignant astonishment laying the principal emphasis on the\nword 'we'\u2014'we fail.' Lastly, she fixed on what I am convinced is\nthe true reading\u2014We fail\u2014with the simple period, modulating\nthe voice to a deep, low, resolute tone which settles the issue\nat once as though she had said: 'If we fail, why then we fail,\nand all is over.'\"\nThis most expressive element of our speech is the last to be\nmastered in attaining to naturalness in speaking a foreign lan-\nguage, and its correct use is the main element in a natural,\nflexible utterance of our native tongue. Without varied inflec-\ntions speech becomes wooden and monotonous.\nThere are but two kinds of inflection, the rising and the fall-\ning, yet these two may be so shaded or so combined that they\nare capable of producing as many varieties of modulation as\nmaybe illustrated by either one or two lines, straight or curved,\nthus:\n\u2022 Sharp rising\n\u2022 Long rising\n\u2022 Level\n\u2022 Long falling\n\u2022 Sharp falling\n\u2022 Sharp rising and falling\n\u2022 Sharp falling and rising\n\u2022 Hesitating\nThese may be varied indefinitely, and serve merely to illus-\ntrate what wide varieties of combination may be effected by\nthese two simple inflections of the voice.\nIt is impossible to tabulate the various inflections which\nserve to express various shades of thought and feeling. A few\nsuggestions are offered here, together with abundant exercises\nfor practise, but the only real way to master inflection is to ob-\nserve, experiment, and practise.\nFor example, take the common sentence, \"Oh, he's all right.\"\nNote how a rising inflection may be made to express faint\npraise, or polite doubt, or uncertainty of opinion. Then note\nhow the same words, spoken with a generally falling inflection\nmay denote certainty, or good-natured approval, or enthusiast-\nic praise, and so on.\n66\nIn general, then, we find that a bending upward of the voice\nwill suggest doubt and uncertainty, while a decided falling in-\nflection will suggest that you are certain of your ground.\nStudents dislike to be told that their speeches are \"not so\nbad,\" spoken with a rising inflection. To enunciate these words\nwith a long falling inflection would indorse the speech rather\nheartily.\nSay good-bye to an imaginary person whom you expect to see\nagain tomorrow; then to a dear friend you never expect to\nmeet again. Note the difference in inflection.\n\"I have had a delightful time,\" when spoken at the termina-\ntion of a formal tea by a frivolous woman takes altogether dif-\nferent inflection than the same words spoken between lovers\nwho have enjoyed themselves. Mimic the two characters in re-\npeating this and observe the difference.\nNote how light and short the inflections are in the following\nbrief quotation from \"Anthony the Absolute,\" by Samuel\nMervin.\nAt Sea\u2014March 28th.\nThis evening I told Sir Robert What's His Name he was a\nfool.\nI was quite right in this.

The first forms, illus-\ntrated above, show change of pitch within a single word; the\nforms you will work out for yourself should show a number of\nsuch inflections throughout the sentence.\nOne of the chief means of securing emphasis is to employ a\nlong falling inflection on the emphatic words\u2014that is, to let the\nvoice fall to a lower pitch on an interior vowel sound in a word.\nTry it on the words \"every,\" \"eleemosynary,\" and \"destroy.\"\n68\nUse long falling inflections on the italicized words in the fol-\nlowing selection, noting their emphatic power.

It is the case not merely of that\nhumble institution; it is the case of every college in our\nland. It is more; it is the case of every eleemosynary in-\nstitution throughout our country\u2014of all those great char-\nities founded by the piety of our ancestors to alleviate\nhuman misery and scatter blessings along the pathway\nof life. Sir, you may destroy this little institution\u2014it\nis weak, it is in your hands. I know it is one of the lesser\nlights in the literary horizon of our country. You may put\nit out.

Too much modulation produces\nan unpleasant effect of artificiality, like a mature matron trying\nto be kittenish. It is a short step between true expression and\nunintentional burlesque. Scrutinize your own tones. Take a\nsingle expression like \"Oh, no!\" or \"Oh, I see,\" or \"Indeed,\" and\nby patient self-examination see how many shades of meaning\nmay be expressed by inflection. This sort of common-sense\npractise will do you more good than a book of rules. But don't\nforget to listen to your own voice.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n69\n1.

We ac-\ncuse him of having given up his people to the merciless\ninflictions of the most hot-headed and hard-hearted of\nprelates; and the defence is, that he took his little son on\nhis knee and kissed him! We censure him for having viol-\nated the articles of the Petition of Right, after having, for\ngood and valuable consideration, promised to observe\nthem; and we are informed that he was accustomed to\nhear prayers at six o'clock in the morning! It is to such\nconsiderations as these, together with his Vandyke\ndress, his handsome face, and his peaked beard, that he\nowes, we verily believe, most of his popularity with the\npresent generation.\n\u2014T.B. Macaulay.\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\nWe needed not that he should put on paper that he be-\nlieved in slavery, who, with treason, with murder, with\ncruelty infernal, hovered around that majestic man to\ndestroy his life. He was himself but the long sting with\nwhich slavery struck at liberty; and he carried the poison\nthat belonged to slavery. As long as this nation lasts, it\nwill never be forgotten that we have one martyred Pres-\nident\u2014never! Never, while time lasts, while heaven\nlasts, while hell rocks and groans, will it be forgotten\nthat slavery, by its minions, slew him, and in slaying him\nmade manifest its whole nature and tendency.\nBut another thing for us to remember is that this blow\nwas aimed at the life of the government and of the na-\ntion. Lincoln was slain; America was meant. The man\nwas cast down; the government was smitten at. It was\nthe President who was killed. It was national life, breath-\ning freedom and meaning beneficence, that was sought.\n71\nHe, the man of Illinois, the private man, divested of\nrobes and the insignia of authority, representing nothing\nbut his personal self, might have been hated; but that\nwould not have called forth the murderer's blow. It was\nbecause he stood in the place of government, represent-\ning government and a government that represented\nright and liberty, that he was singled out.\nThis, then, is a crime against universal government. It is\nnot a blow at the foundations of our government, more\nthan at the foundations of the English government, of\nthe French government, of every compact and well-or-\nganized government. It was a crime against mankind.\nThe whole world will repudiate and stigmatize it as a\ndeed without a shade of redeeming light\u2026 .\nThe blow, however, has signally failed. The cause is not\nstricken; it is strengthened. This nation has dis-\nsolved,\u2014but in tears only. It stands, four-square, more\nsolid, to-day, than any pyramid in Egypt. This people are\nneither wasted, nor daunted, nor disordered. Men hate\nslavery and love liberty with stronger hate and love to-\nday than ever before. The Government is not weakened,\nit is made stronger\u2026 .\nAnd now the martyr is moving in triumphal march, migh-\ntier than when alive. The nation rises up at every stage\nof his coming. Cities and states are his pall-bearers, and\nthe cannon beats the hours with solemn progression.\nDead\u2014dead\u2014dead\u2014he yet speaketh! Is Washington\ndead? Is Hampden dead? Is David dead? Is any man\ndead that ever was fit to live? Disenthralled of flesh, and\nrisen to the unobstructed sphere where passion never\ncomes, he begins his illimitable work. His life now is\ngrafted upon the Infinite, and will be fruitful as no\nearthly life can be. Pass on, thou that hast overcome!\nYour sorrows O people, are his peace! Your bells, and\nbands, and muffled drums sound triumph in his ear. Wail\nand weep here; God makes it echo joy and triumph\nthere. Pass on, victor!\nFour years ago, O Illinois, we took from your midst an\nuntried man, and from among the people; we return him\nto you a mighty conqueror. Not thine any more, but the\n72\nnation's; not ours, but the world's. Give him place, ye\nprairies! In the midst of this great Continent his dust\nshall rest, a sacred treasure to myriads who shall make\npilgrimage to that shrine to kindle anew their zeal and\npatriotism. Ye winds, that move over the mighty places\nof the West, chant his requiem! Ye people, behold a mar-\ntyr, whose blood, as so many inarticulate words, pleads\nfor fidelity, for law, for liberty!\u2014Henry Ward Beecher.\nTHE HISTORY OF LIBERTY\nThe event which we commemorate is all-important, not\nmerely in our own annals, but in those of the world. The\nsententious English poet has declared that \"the proper\nstudy of mankind is man,\" and of all inquiries of a tem-\nporal nature, the history of our fellow-beings is unques-\ntionably among the most interesting. But not all the\nchapters of human history are alike important. The an-\nnals of our race have been filled up with incidents which\nconcern not, or at least ought not to concern, the great\ncompany of mankind. History, as it has often been writ-\nten, is the genealogy of princes, the field-book of con-\nquerors; and the fortunes of our fellow-men have been\ntreated only so far as they have been affected by the in-\nfluence of the great masters and destroyers of our race.\nSuch history is, I will not say a worthless study, for it is\nnecessary for us to know the dark side as well as the\nbright side of our condition. But it is a melancholy study\nwhich fills the bosom of the philanthropist and the friend\nof liberty with sorrow.\nBut the history of liberty\u2014the history of men struggling\nto be free\u2014the history of men who have acquired and\nare exercising their freedom\u2014the history of those great\nmovements in the world, by which liberty has been es-\ntablished and perpetuated, forms a subject which we\ncannot contemplate too closely. This is the real history of\nman, of the human family, of rational immortal beings\u2026 .\nThe trial of adversity was theirs; the trial of prosperity is\nours. Let us meet it as men who know their duty and\nprize their blessings. Our position is the most enviable,\nthe most responsible, which men can fill. If this genera-\ntion does its duty, the cause of constitutional freedom is\n73\nsafe. If we fail\u2014if we fail\u2014not only do we defraud our\nchildren of the inheritance which we received from our\nfathers, but we blast the hopes of the friends of liberty\nthroughout our continent, throughout Europe,\nthroughout the world, to the end of time.\nHistory is not without her examples of hard-fought fields,\nwhere the banner of liberty has floated triumphantly on\nthe wildest storm of battle. She is without her examples\nof a people by whom the dear-bought treasure has been\nwisely employed and safely handed down. The eyes of\nthe world are turned for that example to us\u2026 .\nLet us, then, as we assemble on the birthday of the na-\ntion, as we gather upon the green turf, once wet with\nprecious blood\u2014let us devote ourselves to the sacred\ncause of constitutional liberty! Let us abjure the in-\nterests and passions which divide the great family of\nAmerican freemen! Let the rage of party spirit sleep to-\nday! Let us resolve that our children shall have cause to\nbless the memory of their fathers, as we have cause to\nbless the memory of ours!\u2014Edward Everett.\n74\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 7\nEFFICIENCY THROUGH INFLECTION\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Attention is the microscope of the mental eye. Its power\nmay be high or low; its field of view narrow or broad.\nWhen high power is used attention is confined within\nvery circumscribed limits, but its action is exceedingly\nintense and absorbing. It sees but few things, but these\nfew are observed \"through and through\" \u2026 Mental en-\nergy and activity, whether of perception or of thought,\nthus concentrated, act like the sun's rays concentrated\nby the burning glass. The object is illumined, heated, set\non fire. Impressions are so deep that they can never be\neffaced. Attention of this sort is the prime condition of\nthe most productive mental labor.\n\u2014Daniel Putnam, Psychology.\nTry to rub the top of your head forward and backward at the\nsame time that you are patting your chest. Unless your powers\nof co\u00f6rdination are well developed you will find it confusing, if\nnot impossible. The brain needs special training before it can\ndo two or more things efficiently at the same instant. It may\nseem like splitting a hair between its north and northwest\ncorner, but some psychologists argue that no brain can think\ntwo distinct thoughts, absolutely simultaneously\u2014that what\nseems to be simultaneous is really very rapid rotation from the\nfirst thought to the second and back again, just as in the above-\ncited experiment the attention must shift from one hand to the\nother until one or the other movement becomes partly or\nwholly automatic.\nWhatever is the psychological truth of this contention it is\nundeniable that the mind measurably loses grip on one idea\nthe moment the attention is projected decidedly ahead to a\nsecond or a third idea.\n75\nA fault in public speakers that is as pernicious as it is com-\nmon is that they try to think of the succeeding sentence while\nstill uttering the former, and in this way their concentration\ntrails off; in consequence, they start their sentences strongly\nand end them weakly. In a well-prepared written speech the\nemphatic word usually comes at one end of the sentence. But\nan emphatic word needs emphatic expression, and this is pre-\ncisely what it does not get when concentration flags by leaping\ntoo soon to that which is next to be uttered. Concentrate all\nyour mental energies on the present sentence. Remember that\nthe mind of your audience follows yours very closely, and if you\nwithdraw your attention from what you are saying to what you\nare going to say, your audience will also withdraw theirs. They\nmay not do so consciously and deliberately, but they will surely\ncease to give importance to the things that you yourself slight.\nIt is fatal to either the actor or the speaker to cross his bridges\ntoo soon.\nOf course, all this is not to say that in the natural pauses of\nyour speech you are not to take swift forward surveys\u2014they\nare as important as the forward look in driving a motor car; the\ncaution is of quite another sort: while speaking one sentence\ndo not think of the sentence to follow. Let it come from its\nproper source\u2014within yourself. You cannot deliver a broadside\nwithout concentrated force\u2014that is what produces the explo-\nsion. In preparation you store and concentrate thought and\nfeeling; in the pauses during delivery you swiftly look ahead\nand gather yourself for effective attack; during the moments of\nactual speech, SPEAK\u2014DON'T ANTICIPATE. Divide your atten-\ntion and you divide your power.\nThis matter of the effect of the inner man upon the outer\ntouching\nfurther word here, particularly\nas\nneeds\nconcentration.\na\n\"What do you read, my lord?\" Hamlet replied, \"Words.\nWords. Words.\" That is a world-old trouble. The mechanical\ncalling of words is not expression, by a long stretch. Did you\never notice how hollow a memorized speech usually sounds?\nYou have listened to the ranting, mechanical cadence of ineffi-\ncient actors, lawyers and preachers. Their trouble is a mental\none\u2014they are not concentratedly thinking thoughts that cause\nwords to issue with sincerity and conviction, but are merely\n76\nenunciating word-sounds mechanically. Painful experience\nalike to audience and to speaker! A parrot is equally eloquent.\nAgain let Shakespeare instruct us, this tune in the insincere\nprayer of the King, Hamlet's uncle. He laments thus pointedly:\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below:\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\nThe truth is, that as a speaker your words must be born\nagain every time they are spoken, then they will not suffer in\ntheir utterance, even though perforce committed to memory\nand repeated, like Dr. Russell Conwell's lecture, \"Acres of Dia-\nmonds,\" five thousand times. Such speeches lose nothing by re-\npetition for the perfectly patent reason that they arise from\nconcentrated thought and feeling and not a mere necessity for\nsaying something\u2014which usually means anything, and that, in\nturn, is tantamount to nothing. If the thought beneath your\nwords is warm, fresh, spontaneous, a part of your self, your ut-\nterance will have breath and life. Words are only a result. Do\nnot try to get the result without stimulating the cause.\nDo you ask how to concentrate? Think of the word itself, and\nof its philological brother, concentric. Think of how a lens gath-\ners and concenters the rays of light within a given circle. It\ncenters them by a process of withdrawal. It may seem like a\nharsh saying, but the man who cannot concentrate is either\nweak of will, a nervous wreck, or has never learned what will-\npower is good for.\nYou must concentrate by resolutely withdrawing your atten-\ntion from everything else. If you concentrate your thought on a\npain which may be afflicting you, that pain will grow more in-\ntense. \"Count your blessings\" and they will multiply. Center\nyour thought on your strokes and your tennis play will gradu-\nally improve. To concentrate is simply to attend to one thing,\nand attend to nothing else. If you find that you cannot do that,\nthere is something wrong\u2014attend to that first. Remove the\ncause and the symptom will disappear. Read the chapter on\n\"Will Power.\" Cultivate your will by willing and then doing, at\nall costs. Concentrate\u2014and you will win.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n77\n1.

Put into about one hundred words your impression of the\neffect produced.\n3. Tell of any peculiar methods you may have observed or\nheard of by which speakers have sought to aid their powers of\nconcentration, such as looking fixedly at a blank spot in the\nceiling, or twisting a watch charm.\n4. What effect do such habits have on the audience?\n5. What relation does pause bear to concentration?\n6. Tell why concentration naturally helps a speaker to change\npitch, tempo, and emphasis.\n7. Read the following selection through to get its meaning\nand spirit clearly in your mind. Then read it aloud, concentrat-\ning solely on the thought that you are expressing\u2014do not\ntrouble about the sentence or thought that is coming. Half the\ntroubles of mankind arise from anticipating trials that never\noccur. Avoid this in speaking.

Tri-\numphantly they wrote \"In Solomon's Porch and in his\ntemple our men rode in the blood of the Saracens up to\nthe knees of their horses.\"\nHistory is an appalling tale of war. In the seventeenth\ncentury Germany, France, Sweden, and Spain warred for\nthirty years. At Magdeburg 30,000 out of 36,000 were\nkilled regardless of sex or age. In Germany schools were\nclosed for a third of a century, homes burned, women\n78\noutraged, towns demolished, and the untilled land be-\ncame a wilderness.\nTwo-thirds of Germany's property was destroyed and\n18,000,000 of her citizens were killed, because men\nquarrelled about the way to glorify \"The Prince of\nPeace.\" Marching through rain and snow, sleeping on\nthe ground, eating stale food or starving, contracting\ndiseases and facing guns that fire six hundred times a\nminute, for fifty cents a day\u2014this is the soldier's life.\nAt the window sits the widowed mother crying. Little\nchildren with tearful faces pressed against the pane\nwatch and wait. Their means of livelihood, their home,\ntheir happiness is gone. Fatherless children, broken-\nhearted women, sick, disabled and dead men\u2014this is the\nwage of war.\nWe spend more money preparing men to kill each other\nthan we do in teaching them to live. We spend more\nmoney building one battleship than in the annual main-\ntenance of all our state universities. The financial loss\nresulting from destroying one another's homes in the\ncivil war would have built 15,000,000 houses, each cost-\ning $2,000. We pray for love but prepare for hate. We\npreach peace but equip for war.\nWere half the power that fills the world with terror,\nWere half the wealth bestowed on camp and court\nGiven to redeem this world from error,\nThere would be no need of arsenal and fort.\nWar only defers a question.

In theatrical parlance, they failed to \"get\nover,\" which means that their message did not get over the\nfoot-lights to the audience. There was no punch, no jab to\nthem\u2014they had no force.\nOf course, all this spells disaster, in big letters, not only in a\nstage production but\nin any platform effort. Every such\npresentation exists solely for the audience, and if it fails to hit\nthem\u2014and the expression is a good one\u2014it has no excuse for\nliving; nor will it live long.\nWhat is Force?\nSome of our most obvious words open up secret meanings\nunder scrutiny, and this is one of them.\nTo begin with, we must recognize the distinction between in-\nner and outer force. The one is cause, the other effect. The one\nis spiritual, the other physical. In this important particular, an-\nimate force differs from inanimate force\u2014the power of man,\ncoming from within and expressing itself outwardly, is of an-\nother sort from the force of Shimose powder, which awaits\nsome influence from without to explode it. However susceptive\nto outside stimuli, the true source of power in man lies within\nhimself. This may seem like \"mere psychology,\" but it has an\nintensely practical bearing on public speaking, as will appear.\nNot only must we discern the difference between human\nforce and mere physical force, but we must not confuse its real\n81\nessence with some of the things that may\u2014and may not\u2014ac-\ncompany it. For example, loudness is not force, though force at\ntimes may be attended by noise. Mere roaring never made a\ngood speech, yet there are moments\u2014moments, mind you, not\nminutes\u2014when big voice power may be used with tremendous\neffect.\nNor is violent motion force\u2014yet force may result in violent\nmotion. Hamlet counseled the players:\nNor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus;\nbut use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and\n(as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must ac-\nquire and beget a temperance, that may give it smooth-\nness. Oh, it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious\nperiwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very\nrags, to split the ears of the groundlings2; who, for the\nmost part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb\nshow, and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for\no'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod. Pray you\navoid it.\nBe not too tame, neither, but let your discretion be your\ntutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action;\nwith this special observance, that you o'erstep not the\nmodesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the\npurpose of playing, whose end, both at the first, and\nnow, was, and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to\nNature, to show Virtue her own feature, Scorn her own\nimage, and the very age and body of the time his form\nand pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,\nthough it make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the\njudicious grieve; the censure of the which one must, in\nyour allowance, o'erweigh a whole theater of others. Oh,\nthere be players that I have seen play\u2014and heard others\npraise, and that highly\u2014not to speak it profanely, that,\nneither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of\nChristian, pagan, or man, have so strutted and bellowed\nthat I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had\nmade men, and not made them well, they imitated hu-\nmanity so abominably.3\n2.Those who sat in the pit or the parquet.\n82\nForce is both a cause and an effect. Inner force, which must\nprecede outer force, is a combination of four elements, acting\nprogressively. First of all, force arises from conviction. You\nmust be convinced of the truth, or the importance, or the\nmeaning, of what you are about to say before you can give it\nforceful delivery. It must lay strong hold upon your convictions\nbefore it can grip your audience. Conviction convinces.\nSpencer Churchill\u2014attributed much\nThe Saturday Evening Post in an article on \"England's\nT.R.\"\u2014Winston\nof\nChurchill's and Roosevelt's public platform success to their\nforceful delivery. No matter what is in hand, these men make\nthemselves believe for the time being that that one thing is the\nmost important on earth. Hence they speak to their audiences\nin a Do-this-or-you-PERISHmanner.\nThat kind of speaking wins, and it is that virile, strenuous,\naggressive attitude which both distinguishes and maintains the\nplatform careers of our greatest leaders.\nthe\nthe\ninquiry\nBut let us look a little closer at the origins of inner force.\nHow does conviction affect the man who feels it? We have\nanswered\nit-\nin\nself\u2014he feels it: Conviction produces emotional tension. Study\nthe pictures of Theodore Roosevelt and of Billy Sunday in ac-\ntion\u2014action is the word. Note the tension of their jaw muscles,\nthe taut lines of sinews in their entire bodies when reaching a\nclimax of force. Moral and physical force are alike in being\nboth preceded and accompanied by in-tens-ity\u2014tension\u2014tight-\nness of the cords of power.\nquestion\nvery\nIt is this tautness of the bow-string, this knotting of the\nmuscles, this contraction before the spring, that makes an\naudience feel\u2014almost see\u2014the reserve power in a speaker. In\nis more what a speaker\nsome really wonderful way it\ndoes not say\ndynamo with-\nand\nin. Anything may come from such stored-up force once it is let\nloose; and that keeps an audience alert, hanging on the lips of\na speaker for his next word. After all, it is all a question of\nmanhood, for a stuffed doll has neither convictions nor emo-\ntional tension. If you are upholstered with sawdust, keep off\nthe platform, for your own speech will puncture you.\nreveals\nthat\nthe\ndo\n3.Hamlet, Act III, Scene 2.\n83\nGrowing out of this conviction-tension comes resolve to make\nthe audience share that conviction-tension. Purpose is the\nbackbone of force; without it speech is flabby\u2014it may glitter,\nbut it is the iridescence of the spineless jellyfish. You must hold\nfast to your resolve if you would hold fast to your audience.\nFinally, all this conviction-tension-purpose is lifeless and use-\nless unless it results in propulsion. You remember how Young\nin his wonderful \"Night Thoughts\" delineates the man who\nPushes his prudent purpose to resolve,\nResolves, and re-resolves, and dies the same.\nLet not your force \"die a-borning,\"\u2014bring it to full life in its\nconviction, emotional tension, resolve, and propulsive power.\nCan Force be Acquired?\nYes, if the acquirer has any such capacities as we have just\noutlined. How to acquire this vital factor is suggested in its\nvery analysis: Live with your subject until you are convinced of\nits importance.\nIf your message does not of\nitself arouse you to ten-\nsion, PULL yourself together. When a man faces the necessity\nof leaping across a crevasse he does not wait for inspiration,\nhe wills his muscles into tensity for the spring\u2014it\nis not\nwithout purpose that our English language uses the same word\nto depict a mighty though delicate steel contrivance and a\nquick leap through the air. Then resolve\u2014and let it all end in\nactual punch.\nThis truth is worth reiteration: The man within is the final\nfactor. He must supply the fuel. The audience, or even the man\nhimself, may add the match\u2014it matters little which, only so\nthat there be fire. However skillfully your engine is construc-\nted, however well it works, you will have no force if the fire has\ngone out under the boiler. It matters little how well you have\nmastered poise, pause, modulation, and tempo, if your speech\nlacks fire it is dead. Neither a dead engine nor a dead speech\nwill move anybody.\nFour factors of force are measurably within your control, and\nin that far may be acquired: ideas, feeling about the sub-\nject, wording, and delivery. Each of these is more or less fully\ndiscussed in this volume, except wording, which really requires\n84\na fuller rhetorical study than can here be ventured. It is,\nhowever, of the utmost importance that you should be aware of\nprecisely how wording bears upon force in a sentence. Study\n\"The Working Principles of Rhetoric,\" by John Franklin\nGenung, or the rhetorical treatises of Adams Sherman Hill, of\nCharles Sears Baldwin, or any others whose names may easily\nbe learned from any teacher.\nHere are a few suggestions on the use of words to attain\nforce:\nChoice of Words\nPLAIN words are more forceful than words less commonly\nused\u2014juggle has more vigor than prestidigitate.\nSHORT words are stronger than long words\u2014end has more\ndirectness than terminate.\nSAXON words are usually more forceful\nthan Latinistic\nwords\u2014for force, use wars against rather than militate against.\ngeneral\nSPECIFIC\nstronger\nwords\nthan\nare\nwords\u2014pressman is more definite than printer.\nCONNOTATIVE words, those that suggest more than they\nsay, have more power than ordinary words\u2014\"She let herself be\nmarried\" expresses more than \"She married.\"\nEPITHETS, figuratively descriptive words, are more effective\nthan direct names\u2014\"Go tell that old fox,\" has more \"punch\"\nthan \"Go tell that sly fellow.\"\nONOMATOPOETIC words, words that convey the sense by\nthe sound, are more powerful than other words\u2014crash is more\neffective than cataclysm.\nArrangement of words\nCut out modifiers.\nCut out connectives.\nBegin with words that demand attention.\n\"End with words that deserve distinction,\" says Prof. Barrett\nWendell.\nSet strong ideas over against weaker ones, so as to gain\nstrength by the contrast.\nAvoid elaborate sentence structure\u2014short sentences are\nstronger than long ones.\nCut out every useless word, so as to give prominence to the\nreally important ones.\n85\nLet each sentence be a condensed battering ram, swinging to\nits final blow on the attention.\nA familiar, homely idiom, if not worn by much use, is more ef-\nfective than a highly formal, scholarly expression.\nConsider well the relative value of different positions in the\nsentence so that you may give the prominent place to ideas you\nwish to emphasize.\n\"But,\" says someone, \"is it not more honest to depend the in-\nherent interest in a subject, its native truth, clearness and sin-\ncerity of presentation, and beauty of utterance, to win your\naudience? Why not charm men instead of capturing them by\nassault?\"\nWhy Use Force?\nThere is much truth in such an appeal, but not all the truth.\nClearness, persuasion, beauty, simple statement of truth, are\nall essential\u2014indeed, they are all definite parts of a forceful\npresentment of a subject, without being the only parts. Strong\nmeat may not be as attractive as ices, but all depends on the\nappetite and the stage of the meal.\nYou can not deliver an aggressive message with caressing\nlittle strokes. No! Jab it in with hard, swift solar plexus\npunches. You cannot strike fire from flint or from an audience\nwith love taps. Say to a crowded theatre in a lackadaisical\nmanner: \"It seems to me that the house is on fire,\" and your an-\nnouncement may be greeted with a laugh. If you flash out the\nwords: \"The house's on fire!\" they will crush one another in\ngetting to the exits.\nThe spirit and the language of force are definite with convic-\ntion. No immortal speech in literature contains such expres-\nsions as \"it seems to me,\" \"I should judge,\" \"in my opinion,\" \"I\nsuppose,\" \"perhaps it is true.\" The speeches that will live have\nbeen delivered by men ablaze with the courage of their convic-\ntions, who uttered their words as eternal truth. Of Jesus it was\nsaid that \"the common people heard Him gladly.\" Why? \"He\ntaught them as one having AUTHORITY.\" An audience will nev-\ner be moved by what \"seems\" to you to be truth or what in your\n\"humble opinion\" may be so. If you honestly can, assert convic-\ntions as your conclusions. Be sure you are right before you\nspeak your speech, then utter your thoughts as though they\nwere a Gibraltar of unimpeachable truth. Deliver them with the\n86\niron hand and confidence of a Cromwell. Assert them with the\nfire of authority. Pronounce them as an ultimatum. If you can-\nnot speak with conviction, be silent.\nWhat force did that young minister have who, fearing to be\ntoo dogmatic, thus exhorted his hearers: \"My friends\u2014as I as-\nsume that you are\u2014it appears to be my duty to tell you that if\nyou do not repent, so to speak, forsake your sins, as it were,\nand turn to righteousness, if I may so express it, you will be\nlost, in a measure\"?\nEffective speech must reflect the era. This is not a rose water\nage, and a tepid, half-hearted speech will not win. This is the\ncentury of trip hammers, of overland expresses that dash un-\nder cities and through mountain tunnels, and you must instill\nthis spirit into your speech if you would move a popular audi-\nence. From a front seat listen to a first-class company present\na modern Broadway drama\u2014not a comedy, but a gripping,\nthrilling drama. Do not become absorbed in the story; reserve\nall your attention for the technique and the force of the acting.\nThere is a kick and a crash as well as an infinitely subtle in-\ntensity in the big, climax-speeches that suggest this lesson: the\nsame well-calculated, restrained, delicately shaded force would\nsimply rivet your ideas in the minds of your audience. An air-\ngun will rattle bird-shot against a window pane\u2014it takes a rifle\nto wing a bullet through plate glass and the oaken walls\nbeyond.\nWhen to Use Force\nAn audience is unlike the kingdom of heaven\u2014the violent do\nnot always take it by force. There are times when beauty and\nserenity should be the only bells in your chime. Force is only\none of the great extremes of contrast\u2014use neither it nor quiet\nutterance to the exclusion of other tones: be various, and in\nvariety find even greater force than you could attain by at-\ntempting its constant use. If you are reading an essay on the\nbeauties of the dawn, talking about the dainty bloom of a\nhoney-suckle, or explaining the mechanism of a gas engine, a\nvigorous style of delivery is entirely out of place. But when you\nare appealing to wills and consciences for immediate action,\nforceful delivery wins. In such cases, consider the minds of\nyour audience as so many safes that have been locked and the\nkeys lost. Do not try to figure out the combinations. Pour a\n87\nlittle nitro glycerine into the cracks and light the fuse. As these\nlines are being written a contractor down the street is clearing\naway the rocks with dynamite to lay the foundations for a great\nbuilding. When you want to get action, do not fear to use\ndynamite.\nThe final argument for the effectiveness of force in public\nspeech is the fact that everything must be enlarged for the pur-\nposes of the platform\u2014that is why so few speeches read well in\nthe reports on the morning after: statements appear crude and\nexaggerated because they are unaccompanied by the forceful\ndelivery of a glowing speaker before an audience heated to at-\ntentive enthusiasm. So in preparing your speech you must not\nerr on the side of mild statement\u2014your audience will inevitably\ntone down your words in the cold grey of afterthought. When\nPhidias was criticised for the rough, bold outlines of a figure he\nhad submitted in competition, he smiled and asked that his\nstatue and the one wrought by his rival should be set upon the\ncolumn for which the sculpture was destined. When this was\ndone all the exaggerations and crudities, toned by distances,\nmelted into exquisite grace of line and form. Each speech must\nbe a special study in suitability and proportion.\nOmit the thunder of delivery, if you will, but like Wendell\nPhillips put \"silent lightning\" into your speech. Make your\nthoughts breathe and your words burn. Birrell said: \"Emerson\nwrites like an electrical cat emitting sparks and shocks in\nevery sentence.\" Go thou and speak likewise. Get the \"big\nstick\" into your delivery\u2014be forceful.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Illustrate, by repeating a sentence from memory, what is\nmeant by employing force in speaking.\n2. Which in your opinion is the most important of the technic-\nal principles of speaking that you have studied so far? Why?\n3. What is the effect of too much force in a speech? Too\nlittle?\n4. Note some uninteresting conversation or ineffective\nspeech, and tell why it failed.\n5. Suggest how it might be improved.\n88\n6. Why do speeches have to be spoken with more force than\ndo conversations?\n7. Read aloud the selection on page 84, using the technical\nprinciples outlined in chapters III to VIII, but neglect to put\nany force behind the interpretation. What is the result?\n8. Reread several times, doing your best to achieve force.\n9. Which parts of the selection on page 84 require the most\nforce?\n10. Write a five-minute speech not only discussing the errors\nof those who exaggerate and those who minimize the use of\nforce, but by imitation show their weaknesses. Do not bur-\nlesque, but closely imitate.\n11. Give a list of ten themes for public addresses, saying\nwhich seem most likely to require the frequent use of force in\ndelivery.\n12. In your own opinion, do speakers usually err from the use\nof too much or too little force?\n13. Define (a) bombast; (b) bathos; (c) sentimentality; (d)\nsqueamish.\n14. Say how the foregoing words describe weaknesses in\npublic speech.\n15. Recast in twentieth-century English \"Hamlet's Directions\nto the Players,\" page 88.\n16. Memorize the following extracts from Wendell Phillips'\nspeeches, and deliver them with the of Wendell Phillips' \"silent\nlightning\" delivery.\nWe are for a revolution! We say in behalf of these hunted\nlyings, whom God created, and who law-abiding Webster\nand Winthrop have sworn shall not find shelter in Mas-\nsachusetts,\u2014we say that they may make their little mo-\ntions, and pass their little laws in Washington, but that\nFaneuil Hall repeals them in the name of humanity and\nthe old Bay State!\nMy advice to workingmen is this:\nIf you want power in this country; if you want to make\nyourselves felt; if you do not want your children to wait\nlong years before they have the bread on the table they\nought to have, the leisure in their lives they ought to\n89\nhave, the opportunities in life they ought to have; if you\ndon't want to wait yourselves,\u2014write on your banner, so\nthat every political trimmer can read it, so that every\npolitician, no matter how short-sighted he may be, can\nread it, \"WE NEVER FORGET! If you launch the arrow of\nsarcasm at labor, WE NEVER FORGET! If there is a divi-\nsion in Congress, and you throw your vote in the wrong\nscale, WE NEVER FORGET! You may go down on your\nknees, and say, 'I am sorry I did the act'\u2014but we will say\n'IT WILL AVAIL YOU IN HEAVEN TO BE SORRY, BUT\nON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, NEVER!'\" So that a man\nin taking up the labor question will know he is dealing\nwith a hair-trigger pistol, and will say, \"I am to be true to\njustice and to man; otherwise I am a dead duck.\"\nIn Russia there is no press, no debate, no explanation of\nwhat government does, no remonstrance allowed, no\nagitation of public issues. Dead silence, like that which\nreigns at the summit of Mont Blanc, freezes the whole\nempire, long ago described as \"a despotism tempered by\nassassination.\" Meanwhile, such despotism has unsettled\nthe brains of the ruling family, as unbridled power\ndoubtless made some of the twelve C\u00e6sars insane; a\nmadman, sporting with the lives and comfort of a hun-\ndred millions of men. The young girl whispers in her\nmother's ear, under a ceiled roof, her pity for a brother\nknouted and dragged half dead into exile for his opin-\nions. The next week she is stripped naked and flogged to\ndeath in the public square. No inquiry, no explanation,\nno trial, no protest, one dead uniform silence, the law of\nthe tyrant. Where is there ground for any hope of peace-\nful change? No, no! in such a land dynamite and the dag-\nger are the necessary and proper substitutes for Faneuil\nHall. Anything that will make the madman quake in his\nbedchamber, and rouse his victims into reckless and des-\nperate resistance. This is the only view an American, the\nchild of 1620 and 1776, can take of Nihilism. Any other\nunsettles and perplexes the ethics of our civilization.\nBorn within sight of Bunker Hill\u2014son of Harvard, whose\nfirst pledge was \"Truth,\" citizen of a republic based on\n90\nthe claim that no government is rightful unless resting\non the consent of the people, and which assumes to lead\nin asserting the rights of humanity\u2014I at least can say\nnothing else and nothing less\u2014no not if every tile on\nCambridge roofs were a devil hooting my words!\nFor practise on forceful selections, use \"The Irrepressible\nConflict,\" page 67; \"Abraham Lincoln,\" page 76, \"Pass Prosper-\nity Around,\" page 470; \"A Plea for Cuba,\" page 50.\n91\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 9\nFORCE\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Enthusiasm is that secret and harmonious spirit that\nhovers over the production of genius.\n\u2014Isaac Disraeli, Literary Character.\nIf you are addressing a body of scientists on such a subject\nas the veins in a butterfly's wings, or on road structure, natur-\nally your theme will not arouse much feeling in either you or\nyour audience. These are purely mental subjects. But if you\nwant men to vote for a measure that will abolish child labor, or\nif you would inspire them to take up arms for freedom, you\nmust strike straight at their feelings. We lie on soft beds, sit\nnear the radiator on a cold day, eat cherry pie, and devote our\nattention to one of the opposite sex, not because we have\nreasoned out that it is the right thing to do, but because it feels\nright. No one but a dyspeptic chooses his diet from a chart.\nOur feelings dictate what we shall eat and generally how we\nshall act. Man is a feeling animal, hence the public speaker's\nability to arouse men to action depends almost wholly on his\nability to touch their emotions.\nNegro mothers on the auction-block seeing their children\nsold away from them into slavery have flamed out some of\nAmerica's most stirring speeches. True, the mother did not\nhave any knowledge of the technique of speaking, but she had\nsomething greater than all technique, more effective than reas-\non: feeling. The great speeches of the world have not been de-\nlivered on tariff reductions or post-office appropriations. The\nspeeches that will live have been charged with emotional force.\nProsperity and peace are poor developers of eloquence. When\ngreat wrongs are to be righted, when the public heart is flam-\ning with passion, that is the occasion for memorable speaking.\nPatrick Henry made an immortal address, for in an epochal\n92\ncrisis he pleaded for liberty. He had roused himself to the point\nwhere he could honestly and passionately exclaim, \"Give me\nliberty or give me death.\" His fame would have been different\nhad he lived to-day and argued for the recall of judges.\nThe Power of Enthusiasm\nPolitical parties hire bands, and pay for applause\u2014they ar-\ngue that, for vote-getting, to stir up enthusiasm is more effect-\nive than reasoning. How far they are right depends on the\nhearers, but there can be no doubt about the contagious nature\nof enthusiasm. A watch manufacturer in New York tried out\ntwo series of watch advertisements; one argued the superior\nconstruction, workmanship, durability, and guarantee offered\nwith the watch; the other was headed, \"A Watch to be Proud\nof,\" and dwelt upon the pleasure and pride of ownership. The\nlatter series sold twice as many as the former. A salesman for a\nlocomotive works informed the writer that in selling railroad\nengines emotional appeal was stronger than an argument\nbased on mechanical excellence.\nIllustrations without number might be cited to show that in\nall our actions we are emotional beings. The speaker who\nwould speak efficiently must develop the power to arouse\nfeeling.\nWebster, great debater that he was, knew that the real\nsecret of a speaker's power was an emotional one. He elo-\nquently says of eloquence:\n\"Affected passion, intense expression, the pomp of de-\nclamation, all may aspire after it; they cannot reach it. It\ncomes, if it come at all, like the outbreak of a fountain\nfrom the earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fires,\nwith spontaneous, original, native force.\n\"The graces taught in the schools, the costly ornaments\nand studied contrivances of speech, shock and disgust\nmen, when their own lives, and the fate of their wives,\ntheir children, and their country hang on the decision of\nthe hour. Then words have lost their power, rhetoric is in\nvain, and all elaborate oratory contemptible. Even geni-\nus itself then feels rebuked and subdued, as in the pres-\nence of higher qualities. Then patriotism is eloquent,\nthen self-devotion is eloquent. The clear conception\n93\noutrunning the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the\nfirm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the\ntongue, beaming from the eye, informing every feature,\nand urging the whole man onward, right onward to his\nsubject\u2014this, this is eloquence; or rather, it is something\ngreater and higher than all eloquence; it is action, noble,\nsublime, godlike action.\"\nWhen traveling through the Northwest some time ago, one of\nthe present writers strolled up a village street after dinner and\nnoticed a crowd listening to a \"faker\" speaking on a corner\nfrom a goods-box. Remembering Emerson's advice about learn-\ning something from every man we meet, the observer stopped\nto listen to this speaker's appeal. He was selling a hair tonic,\nwhich he claimed to have discovered in Arizona. He removed\nhis hat to show what this remedy had done for him, washed his\nface in it to demonstrate that it was as harmless as water, and\nenlarged on its merits in such an enthusiastic manner that the\nhalf-dollars poured in on him in a silver flood. When he had\nsupplied the audience with hair tonic, he asked why a greater\nproportion of men than women were bald. No one knew. He ex-\nplained that it was because women wore thinner-soled shoes,\nand so made a good electrical connection with mother earth,\nwhile men wore thick, dry-soled shoes that did not transmit the\nearth's electricity to the body. Men's hair, not having a proper\namount of electrical food, died and fell out. Of course he had a\nremedy\u2014a little copper plate that should be nailed on the bot-\ntom of the shoe. He pictured in enthusiastic and vivid terms\nthe desirability of escaping baldness\u2014and paid tributes to his\ncopper plates. Strange as it may seem when the story is told in\ncold print, the speaker's enthusiasm had swept his audience\nwith him, and they crushed around his stand with outstretched\n\"quarters\" in their anxiety to be the possessors of these magic-\nal plates!\nEmerson's suggestion had been well taken\u2014the observer had\nseen again the wonderful, persuasive power of enthusiasm!\nEnthusiasm sent millions crusading into the Holy Land to re-\ndeem it from the Saracens. Enthusiasm plunged Europe into a\nthirty years' war over religion. Enthusiasm sent three small\nships plying the unknown sea to the shores of a new world.\n94\nWhen Napoleon's army were worn out and discouraged in their\nascent of the Alps, the Little Corporal stopped them and\nordered the bands to play the Marseillaise. Under its soul-stir-\nring strains there were no Alps.\nListen! Emerson said: \"Nothing great was ever achieved\nwithout enthusiasm.\" Carlyle declared that \"Every great move-\nment in the annals of history has been the triumph of enthusi-\nasm.\" It is as contagious as measles. Eloquence is half inspira-\ntion. Sweep your audience with you in a pulsation of enthusi-\nasm. Let yourself go. \"A man,\" said Oliver Cromwell, \"never\nrises so high as when he knows not whither he is going.\"\nHow are We to Acquire and Develop Enthusiasm?\nIt is not to be slipped on like a smoking jacket. A book cannot\nfurnish you with it. It is a growth\u2014an effect. But an effect of\nwhat? Let us see.\nEmerson wrote: \"A painter told me that nobody could draw a\ntree without in some sort becoming a tree; or draw a child by\nstudying the outlines of his form merely,\u2014but, by watching for\na time his motion and plays, the painter enters his nature, and\nthen can draw him at will in every attitude. So Roos 'entered\ninto the inmost nature of his sheep.' I knew a draughtsman em-\nployed in a public survey, who found that he could not sketch\nthe rocks until their geological structure was first explained to\nhim.\"\nWhen Sarah Bernhardt plays a difficult role she frequently\nwill speak to no one from four o'clock in the afternoon until\nafter the performance. From the hour of four she lives her\ncharacter. Booth, it is reported, would not permit anyone to\nspeak to him between the acts of his Shakesperean r\u00f4les, for\nhe was Macbeth then\u2014not Booth. Dante, exiled from his be-\nlived in caves, half\nloved Florence, condemned to death,\nstarved; then Dante wrote out his heart in \"The Divine Com-\nedy.\" Bunyan entered into the spirit of his \"Pilgrim's Progress\"\nso thoroughly that he fell down on the floor of Bedford jail and\nwept for joy. Turner, who lived in a garret, arose before day-\nbreak and walked over the hills nine miles to see the sun rise\non the ocean, that he might catch the spirit of its wonderful\nbeauty. Wendell Phillips' sentences were full of \"silent light-\nning\" because he bore in his heart the sorrow of five million\nslaves.\n95\nThere is only one way to get feeling into your speaking\u2014and\nwhatever else you forget, forget not this: You must actually\nENTER INTO the character you impersonate, the cause you ad-\nvocate, the case you argue\u2014enter into it so deeply that it\nclothes you, enthralls you, possesses you wholly. Then you are,\nin the true meaning of the word, in sympathy with your sub-\nject, for its feeling is your feeling, you \"feel with\" it, and there-\nfore your enthusiasm is both genuine and contagious. The Car-\npenter who spoke as \"never man spake\" uttered words born\nout of a passion of love for humanity\u2014he had entered into hu-\nmanity, and thus became Man.\nBut we must not look upon the foregoing words as a facile\nprescription for decocting a feeling which may then be ladled\nout to a complacent audience in quantities to suit the need of\nthe moment. Genuine feeling in a speech is bone and blood of\nthe speech itself and not something that may be added to it or\nsubstracted at will. In the ideal address theme, speaker and\naudience become one, fused by the emotion and thought of the\nhour.\nThe Need of Sympathy for Humanity\nIt is impossible to lay too much stress on the necessity for\nthe speaker's having a broad and deep tenderness for human\nnature. One of Victor Hugo's biographers attributes his power\nas an orator and writer to his wide sympathies and profound\nreligious feelings. Recently we heard the editor of Collier's\nWeekly speak on short-story writing, and he so often emphas-\nized the necessity for this broad love for humanity, this truly\nreligious feeling, that he apologized twice for delivering a ser-\nmon. Few if any of the immortal speeches were ever delivered\nfor a selfish or a narrow cause\u2014they were born out of a pas-\nsionate desire to help humanity; instances, Paul's address to\nthe Athenians on Mars Hill, Lincoln's Gettysburg speech, The\nSermon on the Mount, Henry's address before the Virginia\nConvention of Delegates.\nThe seal and sign of greatness is a desire to serve others.\nSelf-preservation is the first law of life, but self-abnegation is\nthe first law of greatness\u2014and of art. Selfishness is the funda-\nmental cause of all sin, it is the thing that all great religions, all\nworthy philosophies, have struck at. Out of a heart of real sym-\npathy and love come the speeches that move humanity.\n96\nFormer United States Senator Albert J. Beveridge in an intro-\nduction to one of the volumes of \"Modern Eloquence,\" says:\n\"The profoundest feeling among the masses, the most influen-\ntial element in their character, is the religious element. It is as\ninstinctive and elemental as the law of self-preservation. It in-\nforms the whole intellect and personality of the people. And he\nwho would greatly influence the people by uttering their un-\nformed thoughts must have this great and unanalyzable bond\nof sympathy with them.\"\nWhen the men of Ulster armed themselves to oppose the pas-\nsage of the Home Rule Act, one of the present writers assigned\nto a hundred men \"Home Rule\" as the topic for an address to\nbe prepared by each. Among this group were some brilliant\nspeakers, several of them experienced lawyers and political\ncampaigners. Some of their addresses showed a remarkable\nknowledge and grasp of the subject; others were clothed in the\nmost attractive phrases. But a clerk, without a great deal of\neducation and experience, arose and told how he spent his boy-\nhood days in Ulster, how his mother while holding him on her\nlap had pictured to him Ulster's deeds of valor. He spoke of a\npicture in his uncle's home that showed the men of Ulster con-\nquering a tyrant and marching on to victory. His voice\nquivered, and with a hand pointing upward he declared that if\nthe men of Ulster went to war they would not go alone\u2014a great\nGod would go with them.\nthe philosophical\nThe speech thrilled and electrified the audience. It thrills yet\nas we recall it. The high-sounding phrases, the historical know-\nthe other speakers\nledge,\nlargely failed to arouse any deep interest, while the genuine\nconviction and feeling of the modest clerk, speaking on a sub-\nject that lay deep in his heart, not only electrified his audience\nbut won their personal sympathy for the cause he advocated.\ntreatment, of\nAs Webster said, it is of no use to try to pretend to sympathy\nor feelings. It cannot be done successfully. \"Nature is forever\nputting a premium on reality.\" What is false is soon detected as\nsuch. The thoughts and feelings that create and mould the\nspeech in the study must be born again when the speech is de-\nlivered from the platform. Do not let your words say one thing,\nand your voice and attitude another. There is no room here for\nhalf-hearted, nonchalant methods of delivery. Sincerity is the\n97\nvery soul of eloquence. Carlyle was right: \"No Mirabeau, Napo-\nleon, Burns, Cromwell, no man adequate to do anything, but is\nfirst of all in right earnest about it; what I call a sincere man. I\nshould say sincerity, a great, deep, genuine sincerity, is the\nfirst characteristic of all men in any way heroic. Not the sincer-\nity that calls itself sincere; ah no, that is a very poor matter in-\ndeed; a shallow braggart, conscious sincerity, oftenest self-con-\nceit mainly. The great man's sincerity is of the kind he cannot\nspeak of\u2014is not conscious of.\"\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\nIt is one thing to convince the would-be speaker that he\nought to put feeling into his speeches; often it is quite another\nthing for him to do it. The average speaker is afraid to let him-\nself go, and continually suppresses his emotions. When you put\nenough feeling into your speeches they will sound overdone to\nyou, unless you are an experienced speaker. They will sound\ntoo strong, if you are not used to enlarging for platform or\nstage, for the delineation of the emotions must be enlarged for\npublic delivery.\n1. Study the following speech, going back in your imagina-\ntion to the time and circumstances that brought it forth. Make\nit not a memorized historical document, but feel the emotions\nthat gave it birth. The speech is only an effect; live over in your\nown heart the causes that produced it and try to deliver it at\nwhite heat. It is not possible for you to put too much real feel-\ning into it, though of course it would be quite easy to rant and\nfill it with false emotion. This speech, according to Thomas Jef-\nferson, started the ball of the Revolution rolling. Men were\nthen willing to go out and die for liberty.\nPATRICK HENRY'S SPEECH\nBEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION OF\nDELEGATES\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illu-\nsions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a pain-\nful truth, and listen to the song of that siren, till she\ntransforms us to beasts. Is this the part of wise men, en-\ngaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are\n98\nwe disposed to be of the number of those who, having\neyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things\nwhich so nearly concern our temporal salvation? For my\npart, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing\nto know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to\nprovide for it.\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and\nthat is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of\njudging of the future but by the past. And judging by the\npast, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct\nof the British Ministry for the last ten years to justify\nthose hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to\nsolace themselves and the House? Is it that insidious\nsmile with which our petition has been lately received?\nTrust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer\nnot yourselves to be \"betrayed with a kiss\"! Ask\nyourselves, how this gracious reception of our petition\ncomports with those warlike preparations which cover\nour waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies\nnecessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we\nshown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force\nmust be called in to win back our love? Let us not de-\nceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war\nand subjugation, the last \"arguments\" to which kings\nresort.\nI ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its\npurpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentle-\nmen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great\nBritain any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call for\nall this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she\nhas none. They are meant for us; they can be meant for\nno other. They are sent over to bind and to rivet upon us\nthose chains which the British Ministry have been so\nlong forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall\nwe try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the\nlast ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the\nsubject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every\nlight of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?\nWhat terms shall we find which have not been already\n99\nexhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive\nourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that\ncould be done, to avert the storm which is now coming\non. We have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have\nsupplicated, we have prostrated ourselves before the\nthrone, and have implored its interposition to arrest the\ntyrannical hands of the Ministry and Parliament. Our pe-\ntitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have pro-\nduced additional violence and insult; our supplications\nhave been disregarded, and we have been spurned with\ncontempt from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these\nthings, may we indulge in the fond hope of peace and re-\nconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we\nwish to be free, if we mean to preserve inviolate those\ninestimable privileges for which we have been so long\ncontending; if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and\nwhich we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until\nthe glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we\nmust fight; I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to\narms, and to the God of Hosts, is all that is left us!\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak\u2014\"unable to cope with\nso formidable an adversary\"! But when shall we be\nstronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will\nit be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\nguard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather\nstrength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire\nthe means of effectual resistance, by lying supinely on\nour backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope,\nuntil our enemies have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we\nare not weak, if we make a proper use of those means\nwhich the God of Nature hath placed in our power.\nThree millions of people, armed in the holy cause of\nLiberty, and in such a country as that which we possess,\nare invincible by any force which our enemy can send\nagainst us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles\nalone. There is a just Power who presides over the des-\ntinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight\nour battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong\nalone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides,\n100\nsir, we have no election. If we were base enough to de-\nsire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There\nis no retreat, but in submission and slavery. Our chains\nare forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains of\nBoston. The war is inevitable; and let it come! I repeat it,\nsir, let it come! It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.\nGentlemen may cry \"Peace, peace!\" but there is no\npeace! The war is actually begun! The next gale that\nsweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of\nresounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field!\nWhy stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish?\nWhat would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,\nas to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\nForbid it, Almighty Powers!\u2014I know not what course\nothers may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give\nme death!\n2. Live over in your imagination all the solemnity and sorrow\nthat Lincoln felt at the Gettysburg cemetery. The feeling in this\nspeech is very deep, but it is quieter and more subdued than\nthe preceding one. The purpose of Henry's address was to get\naction; Lincoln's speech was meant only to dedicate the last\nresting place of those who had acted. Read it over and over\n(see page 50) until it burns in your soul. Then commit it and re-\npeat it for emotional expression.\n3. Beecher's speech on Lincoln, page 76; Thurston's speech\non \"A Plea for Cuba,\" page 50; and the following selection, are\nrecommended for practise in developing feeling in delivery.\nA living force that brings to itself all the resources of\nimagination, all the inspirations of feeling, all that is in-\nfluential in body, in voice, in eye, in gesture, in posture,\nin the whole animated man, is in strict analogy with the\ndivine thought and the divine arrangement; and there is\nno misconstruction more utterly untrue and fatal than\nthis: that oratory is an artificial thing, which deals with\nbaubles and trifles, for the sake of making bubbles of\npleasure for transient effect on mercurial audiences. So\nfar from that, it is the consecration of the whole man to\nthe noblest purposes to which one can address\n101\nhimself\u2014the education and inspiration of his fellow men\nby all that there is in learning, by all that there is in\nthought, by all that there is in feeling, by all that there is\nin all of them, sent home through the channels of taste\nand of beauty.\u2014Henry Ward Beecher.\n4. What in your opinion are the relative values of thought and\nfeeling in a speech?\n5. Could we dispense with either?\n6. What kinds of selections or occasions require much feeling\nand enthusiasm? Which require little?\n7. Invent a list of ten subjects for speeches, saying which\nwould give most room for pure thought and which for feeling.\n8. Prepare and deliver a ten-minute speech denouncing the\n(imaginary) unfeeling plea of an attorney; he may be either the\ncounsel for the defense or the prosecuting attorney, and the\naccused may be assumed to be either guilty or innocent, at\nyour option.\n9. Is feeling more important than the technical principles ex-\npounded in chapters III to VII? Why?\n10. Analyze the secret of some effective speech or speaker.\nTo what is the success due?\n11. Give an example from your own observation of the effect\nof feeling and enthusiasm on listeners.\n12. Memorize Carlyle's\nand Emerson's\nremarks\non\nenthusiasm.\n13. Deliver Patrick Henry's address, page 110, and\nThurston's speech, page 50, without show of feeling or enthusi-\nasm. What is the result?\n14. Repeat, with all the feeling these selections demand.\nWhat is the result?\n15. What steps do you intend to take to develop the power of\nenthusiasm and feeling in speaking?\n16. Write and deliver a five-minute speech ridiculing a speak-\ner who uses bombast, pomposity and over-enthusiasm. Imitate\nhim.\n102\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 10\nFEELING AND ENTHUSIASM\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Animis opibusque parati\u2014Ready in mind and resources.\n\u2014Motto of South Carolina.\nIn omnibus negotiis prius quam aggrediare, adhibenda\nest pr\u00e6paratio diligens\u2014In all matters before beginning\na diligent preparation should be made.\n\u2014Cicero, De Officiis.\nTake your dictionary and look up the words that contain the\nLatin stem flu\u2014the results will be suggestive.\nAt first blush it would seem that fluency consists in a ready,\neasy use of words. Not so\u2014the flowing quality of speech is\nmuch more, for it is a composite effect, with each of its prior\nconditions deserving of careful notice.\nThe Sources of Fluency\nSpeaking broadly, fluency is almost entirely a matter of pre-\nparation. Certainly, native gifts figure largely here, as in every\nart, but even natural facility is dependent on the very same\nlaws of preparation that hold good for the man of supposedly\nsmall native endowment. Let this encourage you if, like Moses,\nyou are prone to complain that you are not a ready speaker.\nHave you ever stopped to analyze that expression, \"a ready\nspeaker?\" Readiness, in its prime sense, is preparedness, and\nthey are most ready who are best prepared. Quick firing de-\npends more on the alert finger than on the hair trigger. Your\nfluency will be in direct ratio to two important conditions: your\nknowledge of what you are going to say, and your being accus-\ntomed to telling what you know to an audience. This gives us\nthe second great element of fluency\u2014to preparation must be\nadded the ease that arises from practise; of which more\npresently.\nKnowledge is Essential\n103\nMr. Bryan is a most fluent speaker when he speaks on polit-\nical problems, tendencies of the time, and questions of morals.\nIt is to be supposed, however, that he would not be so fluent in\nspeaking on the bird life of the Florida Everglades. Mr. John\nBurroughs might be at his best on this last subject, yet entirely\nlost in talking about international law. Do not expect to speak\nfluently on a subject that you know little or nothing about. Cte-\nsiphon boasted that he could speak all day (a sin in itself) on\nany subject that an audience would suggest. He was banished\nby the Spartans.\nBut preparation goes beyond the getting of the facts in the\ncase you are to present: it includes also the ability to think and\narrange your thoughts, a full and precise vocabulary, an easy\nmanner of speech and breathing, absence of self-conscious-\nness, and the several other characteristics of efficient delivery\nthat have deserved special attention in other parts of this book\nrather than in this chapter.\nPreparation may be either general or specific; usually it\nshould be both. A life-time of reading, of companionship with\nstirring thoughts, of wrestling with the problems of life\u2014this\nconstitutes a general preparation of inestimable worth. Out of\na well-stored mind, and\u2014richer still\u2014a broad experience,\nand\u2014best of all\u2014a warmly sympathetic heart, the speaker will\nhave to draw much material that noimmediate study could\nprovide. General preparation consists of all that a man has put\ninto himself, all that heredity and environment have instilled\ninto him, and\u2014that other rich source of preparedness for\nspeech\u2014the friendship of wise companions. When Schiller re-\nturned home after a visit with Goethe a friend remarked: \"I am\namazed by the progress Schiller can make within a single fort-\nnight.\" It was the progressive influence of a new friendship.\nProper friendships form one of the best means for the forma-\ntion of ideas and ideals, for they enable one to practise in giv-\ning expression to thought. The speaker who would speak flu-\nently before an audience should learn to speak fluently and en-\ntertainingly with a friend. Clarify your ideas by putting them in\nwords; the talker gains as much from his conversation as the\nlistener. You sometimes begin to converse on a subject think-\ning you have very little to say, but one idea gives birth to an-\nother, and you are surprised to learn that the more you give\n104\nthe more you have to give. This give-and-take of friendly con-\nversation develops mentality, and fluency in expression. Long-\nfellow said: \"A single conversation across the table with a wise\nman is better than ten years' study of books,\" and Holmes\nwhimsically yet none the less truthfully declared that half the\ntime he talked to find out what he thought. But that method\nmust not be applied on the platform!\nAfter all this enrichment of life by storage, must come the\nspecial preparation for the particular speech. This is of so def-\ninite a sort that it warrants separate chapter-treatment later.\nPractise\nBut preparation must also be of another sort than the gather-\nin-\ning, organizing, and shaping of materials\u2014it must\nclude practise, which, like mental preparation, must be both\ngeneral and special.\nDo not feel surprised or discouraged if practise on the prin-\nciples of delivery herein laid down seems to retard your flu-\nency. For a time, this will be inevitable. While you are working\nfor proper inflection, for instance, inflection will be demanding\nyour first thoughts, and the flow of your speech, for the time\nbeing, will be secondary. This warning, however, is strictly for\nfor your practise at home. Do not carry any\nthe closet,\nthoughts of inflection with you to the platform. There you\nmust think only of your subject. There is an absolute telepathy\nbetween the audience and the speaker. If your thought goes to\nyour gesture, their thought will too. If your interest goes to the\nquality of your voice, they will be regarding that instead of\nwhat your voice is uttering.\nYou have doubtless been adjured to \"forget everything but\nyour subject.\" This advice says either too much or too little.\nThe truth is that while on the platform you must not forget a\ngreat many things that are not in your subject, but you must\nnot think of them. Your attention must consciously go only to\nyour message, but subconsciously you will be attending to the\npoints of technique which have become more or less habitual\nby practise.\nA nice balance between these two kinds of attention is\nimportant.\nYou can no more escape this law than you can live without\nair: Your platform gestures, your voice, your inflection, will all\n105\nbe just as good as your habit of gesture, voice, and inflection\nmakes them\u2014no better. Even the thought of whether you are\nspeaking fluently or not will have the effect of marring your\nflow of speech.\nReturn to the opening chapter, on self-confidence, and again\nlay its precepts to heart. Learn by rules to speak without think-\ning of rules. It is not\u2014or ought not to be\u2014necessary for you to\nstop to think how to say the alphabet correctly, as a matter of\nfact it is slightly more difficult for you to repeat Z, Y, X than it\nis to say X, Y, Z\u2014habit has established the order. Just so you\nmust master the laws of efficiency in speaking until it is a\nsecond nature for you to speak correctly rather than otherwise.\nA beginner at the piano has a great deal of trouble with the\nmechanics of playing, but as time goes on his fingers become\ntrained and almost instinctively wander over the keys cor-\nrectly. As an inexperienced speaker you will find a great deal\nof difficulty at first in putting principles into practise, for you\nwill be scared, like the young swimmer, and make some crude\nstrokes, but if you persevere you will \"win out.\"\nThus, to sum up, the vocabulary you have enlarged by\nstudy,4 the ease in speaking you have developed by practise,\nthe economy of your well-studied emphasis all will subcon-\nsciously come to your aid on the platform. Then the habits you\nhave formed will be earning you a splendid dividend. The flu-\nency of your speech will be at the speed of flow your practise\nhas made habitual.\nBut\nthis means work. What good habit does not? No\nphilosopher's stone that will act as a substitute for laborious\npractise has ever been found. If it were, it would be thrown\naway, because it would kill our greatest joy\u2014the delight of ac-\nquisition. If public-speaking means to you a fuller life, you will\nknow no greater happiness than a well-spoken speech. The\ntime you have spent in gathering ideas and in private practise\nof speaking you will find amply rewarded.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

Leaving the message aside,\nthe same may justly be said of public speaking. A rich,\ncorrectly-used voice is the greatest physical factor of persuas-\niveness and power, often over-topping the effects of reason.\nBut a good voice, well handled, is not only an effective pos-\nsession for the professional speaker, it is a mark of personal\nculture as well, and even a distinct commercial asset. Glad-\nstone, himself the possessor of a deep, musical voice, has said:\n\"Ninety men in every hundred in the crowded professions will\nprobably never rise above mediocrity because the training of\nthe voice is entirely neglected and considered of no import-\nance.\" These are words worth pondering.\nThere are three fundamental requisites for a good voice:\n1. Ease\nSignor Bonci of the Metropolitan Opera Company says that\nthe secret of good voice is relaxation; and this is true, for relax-\nation is the basis of ease. The air waves that produce voice res-\nult in a different kind of tone when striking against relaxed\nmuscles than when striking constricted muscles. Try this for\nyourself. Contract the muscles of your face and throat as you\ndo in hate, and flame out \"I hate you!\" Now relax as you do\nwhen thinking gentle, tender thoughts, and say, \"I love you.\"\nHow different the voice sounds.\nIn practising voice exercises, and in speaking, never force\nyour tones. Ease must be your watchword. The voice is a delic-\nate instrument, and you must not handle it with hammer and\n111\ntongs. Don't make your voice go\u2014let it go. Don't work. Let the\nyoke of speech be easy and its burden light.\nYour throat should be free from strain during speech, there-\nfore it is necessary to avoid muscular contraction. The throat\nmust act as a sort of chimney or funnel for the voice, hence any\nunnatural constriction will not only harm its tones but injure its\nhealth.\nNervousness and mental strain are common sources of\nmouth and throat constriction, so make the battle for poise and\nself-confidence for which we pleaded in the opening chapter.\nBut how can I relax? you ask. By simply willing to relax. Hold\nyour arm out straight from your shoulder. Now\u2014withdraw all\npower and let it fall. Practise relaxation of the muscles of the\nthroat by letting your neck and head fall forward. Roll the up-\nper part of your body around, with the waist line acting as a\npivot. Let your head fall and roll around as you shift the torso\nto different positions. Do not force your head around\u2014simply\nrelax your neck and let gravity pull it around as your body\nmoves.\nAgain, let your head fall forward on your breast; raise your\nhead, letting your jaw hang. Relax until your jaw feels heavy,\nas though it were a weight hung to your face. Remember, you\nmust relax the jaw to obtain command of it. It must be free and\nflexible for the moulding of tone, and to let the tone pass out\nunobstructed.\nThe lips also must be made flexible, to aid in the moulding of\nclear and beautiful tones. For flexibility of lips repeat the syl-\nlables,mo\u2014me. In saying mo, bring the lips up to resemble the\nshape of the letter O. In repeating me draw them back as you\ndo in a grin. Repeat this exercise rapidly, giving the lips as\nmuch exercise as possible.\nTry the following exercise in the same manner:\nMo\u2014E\u2014O\u2014E\u2014OO\u2014Ah.\nAfter this exercise has been mastered, the following will also\nbe found excellent for flexibility of lips:\nMemorize these sounds indicated (not the expressions) so\nthat you can repeat them rapidly.\nA as in May. E as in Met. U as in Use.\nOil.\nA \"\nOur.\nA \"\nIce. Oi \"\nu \"\nIt.\nAh.\nAt.\n\"\n\"\nI\nI\n112\nO \"\nA \"\nE \"\nNo. O \"\nAll. OO \"\nEat. OO \"\nNo. O \"\nFoot. A \"\nOoze. E \"\nOoze.\nAh.\nEat.\nAll the activity of breathing must be centered, not in the\nthroat, but in the middle of the body\u2014you must breathe from\nthe diaphragm. Note the way you breathe when lying flat on\nthe back, undressed in bed. You will observe that all the activ-\nity then centers around the diaphragm. This is the natural and\ncorrect method of breathing. By constant watchfulness make\nthis your habitual manner, for it will enable you to relax more\nperfectly the muscles of the throat.\nThe next fundamental requisite for good voice is\n2. Openness\nIf the muscles of the throat are constricted, the tone passage\npartially closed, and the mouth kept half-shut, how can you ex-\npect the tone to come out bright and clear, or even to come out\nat all? Sound is a series of waves, and if you make a prison of\nyour mouth, holding the jaws and lips rigidly, it will be very dif-\nficult for the tone to squeeze through, and even when it does\nescape it will lack force and carrying power. Open your mouth\nwide, relax all the organs of speech, and let the tone flow out\neasily.\nStart to yawn, but instead of yawning, speak while your\nthroat is open. Make this open-feeling habitual when speak-\ning\u2014we saymake because it is a matter of resolution and of\npractise, if your vocal organs are healthy. Your tone passages\nmay be partly closed by enlarged tonsils, adenoids, or enlarged\nturbinate bones of the nose. If so, a skilled physician should be\nconsulted.\nThe nose is an important tone passage and should be kept\nopen and free for perfect tones. What we call \"talking through\nthe nose\" is not talking through the nose, as you can easily\ndemonstrate by holding your nose as you talk. If you are\nbothered with nasal tones caused by growths or swellings in\nthe nasal passages, a slight, painless operation will remove the\nobstruction. This is quite important, aside from voice, for the\ngeneral health will be much lowered if the lungs are continu-\nally starved for air.\nThe final fundamental requisite for good voice is\n3. Forwardness\n113\nA voice that is pitched back in the throat is dark, sombre,\nand unattractive. The tone must be pitched forward, but do\nnot force it forward. You will recall that our first principle was\nease. Think the tone forward and out. Believe it is going for-\nward, and allow it to flow easily. You can tell whether you are\nplacing your tone forward or not by inhaling a deep breath and\nsinging ah with the mouth wide open, trying to feel the little\ndelicate sound waves strike the bony arch of the mouth just\nabove the front teeth. The sensation is so slight that you will\nprobably not be able to detect it at once, but persevere in your\npractise, always thinking the tone forward, and you will be re-\nwarded by feeling your voice strike the roof of your mouth. A\ncorrect forward-placing of the tone will do away with the dark,\nthroaty tones that are so unpleasant, inefficient, and harmful to\nthe throat.\nClose the lips, humming ng, im, or an. Think the tone for-\nward. Do you feel it strike the lips?\nHold the palm of your hand in front of your face and say vig-\norously crash, dash, whirl, buzz. Can you feel the forward\ntones strike against your hand? Practise until you can. Remem-\nber, the only way to get your voice forward is to put it forward.\nHow to Develop the Carrying Power of the Voice\nIt is not necessary to speak loudly in order to be heard at a\ndistance. It is necessary only to speak correctly. Edith Wynne\nMatthison's voice will carry in a whisper throughout a large\ntheater. A paper rustling on the stage of a large auditorium can\nbe heard distinctly in the furthermost seat in the gallery. If you\nwill only use your voice correctly, you will not have much diffi-\nculty in being heard. Of course it is always well to address your\nspeech to your furthest auditors; if they get it, those nearer\nwill have no trouble, but aside from this obvious suggestion,\nyou must observe these laws of voice production:\nRemember to apply the principles of ease, openness and for-\nwardness\u2014they are the prime factors in enabling your voice to\nbe heard at a distance.\nDo not gaze at the floor as you talk. This habit not only gives\nthe speaker an amateurish appearance but if the head is hung\nforward the voice will be directed towards the ground instead\nof floating out over the audience.\n114\nVoice is a series of air vibrations. To strengthen it two things\nare necessary: more air or breath, and more vibration.\nBreath is the very basis of voice. As a bullet with little\npowder behind it will not have force and carrying power, so the\nvoice that has little breath behind it will be weak. Not only will\ndeep breathing\u2014breathing from the diaphragm\u2014give the voice\na better support, but it will give it a stronger resonance by im-\nproving the general health.\nUsually, ill health means a weak voice, while abundant phys-\nical vitality is shown through a strong, vibrant voice. Therefore\nanything that improves the general vitality is an excellent voice\nstrengthener, provided you use the voice properly. Authorities\ndiffer on most of the rules of hygiene but on one point they all\nagree: vitality and longevity are increased by deep breathing.\nPractise this until it becomes second nature. Whenever you are\nspeaking, take in deep breaths, but in such a manner that the\ninhalations will be silent.\nDo not try to speak too long without renewing your breath.\nNature cares for this pretty well unconsciously in conversation,\nand she will do the same for you in platform speaking if you do\nnot interfere with her premonitions.\nA certain very successful speaker developed voice carrying\npower by running across country, practising his speeches as he\nwent. The vigorous exercise forced him to take deep breaths,\nand developed lung power. A hard-fought basketball or tennis\ngame is an efficient way of practising deep breathing. When\nthese methods are not convenient, we recommend the\nfollowing:\nPlace your hands at your sides, on the waist line.\nBy trying to encompass your waist with your fingers and\nthumbs, force all the air out of the lungs.\nTake a deep breath. Remember, all the activity is to be\ncentered in the middle of the body; do not raise the shoulders.\nAs the breath is taken your hands will be forced out.\nRepeat the exercise, placing your hands on the small of the\nback and forcing them out as you inhale.\nMany methods for deep breathing have been given by vari-\nous authorities. Get the air into your lungs\u2014that is the import-\nant thing.\n115\nThe body acts as a sounding board for the voice just as the\nbody of the violin acts as a sounding board for its tones. You\ncan increase its vibrations by practise.\nPlace your finger on your lip and hum the musical scale,\nthinking and placing the voice forward on the lips. Do you feel\nthe lips vibrate? After a little practise they will vibrate, giving a\ntickling sensation.\nRepeat this exercise, throwing the humming sound into the\nnose. Hold the upper part of the nose between the thumb and\nforefinger. Can you feel the nose vibrate?\nPlacing the palm of your hand on top of your head, repeat\nthis humming exercise. Think the voice there as you hum in\nhead tones. Can you feel the vibration there?\nNow place the palm of your hand on the back of your head,\nrepeating the foregoing process. Then try it on the chest. Al-\nways remember to think your tone where you desire to feel the\nvibrations. The mere act of thinking about any portion of your\nbody will tend to make it vibrate.\nRepeat the following, after a deep inhalation, endeavoring to\nfeel all portions of your body vibrate at the same time. When\nyou have attained this you will find that it is a pleasant\nsensation.\nWhat ho, my jovial mates. Come on! We will frolic it like\nfairies, frisking in the merry moonshine.\nPurity of Voice\nThis quality is sometimes destroyed by wasting the breath.\nCarefully control the breath, using only as much as is neces-\nsary for the production of tone. Utilize all that you give out.\nFailure to do this results in a breathy tone. Take in breath like\na prodigal; in speaking, give it out like a miser.\nVoice Suggestions\nNever attempt to force your voice when hoarse.\nDo not drink cold water when speaking. The sudden shock to\nthe heated organs of speech will injure the voice.\nAvoid pitching your voice too high\u2014it will make it raspy. This\nis a common fault. When you find your voice in too high a\nrange, lower it. Do not wait until you get to the platform to try\nthe\nthis. Practise it\nin your daily conversation. Repeat\n116\nalphabet, beginning A on the lowest scale possible and going\nup a note on each succeeding letter, for the development of\nrange. A wide range will give you facility in making numerous\nchanges of pitch.\nDo not form the habit of listening to your voice when speak-\ning. You will need your brain to think of what you are say-\ning\u2014reserve your observation for private practise.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. What are the prime requisites for good voice?\n2. Tell why each one is necessary for good voice production.\n3. Give some exercises for development of these conditions.\n4. Why is range of voice desirable?\n5. Tell how range of voice may be cultivated.\n6. How much daily practise do you consider necessary for the\nproper development of your voice?\n7. How can resonance and carrying power be developed?\n8.

The lovely minor cadences of bird song at twilight are al-\nmost depressing.\nThe reason we are affected to sadness by certain forms of\nplacid beauty is twofold: movement is stimulating and joy-pro-\nducing, while quietude leads to reflection, and reflection in\nturn often brings out the tone of regretful longing for that\nwhich is past; secondly, quiet beauty produces a vague aspira-\ntion for the relatively unattainable, yet does not stimulate to\nthe tremendous effort necessary to make the dimly desired\nstate or object ours.\nWe must distinguish, for these reasons, between the sadness\nof beauty and the joy of beauty. True, joy is a deep, inner thing\nand takes in much more than the idea of bounding, sanguine\nspirits, for it includes a certain active contentedness of heart.\nIn this chapter, however the word will have its optimistic, ex-\nuberant connotation\u2014we are thinking now of vivid, bright-\neyed, laughing joy.\nMusical, joyous tones constitute voice charm, a subtle mag-\nnetism that is delightfully contagious. Now it might seem to the\n118\ndesultory reader that to take the lancet and cut into this allur-\ning voice quality would be to dissect a butterfly wing and so\ndestroy its charm. Yet how can we induce an effect if we are\nnot certain as to the cause?\nNasal Resonance Produces the Bell-tones of the Voice\nThe tone passages of the nose must be kept entirely free for\nthe bright tones of voice\u2014and after our warning in the preced-\ning chapter you will not confuse what is popularly and erro-\nneously called a \"nasal\" tone with the true nasal quality, which\nis so well illustrated by the voice work of trained French sing-\ners and speakers.\nTo develop nasal resonance sing the following, dwelling as\nlong as possible on the ng sounds. Pitch the voice in the nasal\ncavity. Practise both in high and low registers, and develop\nrange\u2014with brightness.\nSing-song. Ding-dong. Hong-kong. Long-thong.\nPractise in the falsetto voice develops a bright quality in the\nnormal speaking-voice. Try the following, and any other selec-\ntions you choose, in a falsetto voice. A man's falsetto voice is\nextremely high and womanish, so men should not practise in\nfalsetto after the exercise becomes tiresome.\nShe perfectly scorned the best of his clan, and declared the\nninth of any man, a perfectly vulgar fraction.\nThe actress Mary Anderson asked the poet Longfellow what\nshe could do to improve her voice. He replied, \"Read aloud\ndaily, joyous, lyric poetry.\"\nThe joyous tones are the bright tones. Develop them by exer-\ncise. Practise your voice exercises in an attitude of joy. Under\nthe influence of pleasure the body expands, the tone passages\nopen, the action of heart and lungs is accelerated, and all the\nprimary conditions for good tone are established.\nMore songs float out from the broken windows of the negro\ncabins in the South than from the palatial homes on Fifth Aven-\nue. Henry Ward Beecher said the happiest days of his life were\nnot when he had become an international character, but when\nhe was an unknown minister out in Lawrenceville, Ohio,\nsweeping his own church, and working as a carpenter to help\npay the grocer. Happiness is largely an attitude of mind, of\nviewing life from the right angle. The optimistic attitude can be\ncultivated, and it will express itself in voice charm. A telephone\n119\ncompany recently placarded this motto in their booths: \"The\nVoice with the Smile Wins.\" It does. Try it.\nReading joyous prose, or lyric poetry, will help put smile and\njoy of soul into your voice. The following selections are excel-\nlent for practise.\nREMEMBER that when you first practise these classics you\nare to give sole attention to two things: a joyous attitude of\nheart and body, and bright tones of voice. After these ends\nhave been attained to your satisfaction, carefully review the\nprinciples of public speaking laid down in the preceding\nchapters and put them into practise as you read these pas-\nsages again and again. It would be better to commit each se-\nlection to memory.\nSELECTIONS FOR PRACTISE\nFROM MILTON'S \"L'ALLEGRO\"\nHaste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee\nJest, and youthful Jollity,\nQuips and Cranks and wanton Wiles,\nNods and Becks, and wreath\u00e8d Smiles,\nSuch as hang on Hebe's cheek,\nAnd love to live in dimple sleek,\u2014\nSport that wrinkled Care derides,\nAnd Laughter holding both his sides.\nCome, and trip it as ye go\nOn the light fantastic toe;\nAnd in thy right hand lead with thee\nThe mountain nymph, sweet Liberty:\nAnd, if I give thee honor due,\nMirth, admit me of thy crew,\nTo live with her, and live with thee,\nIn unreprov\u00e8d pleasures free;\nTo hear the lark begin his flight,\nAnd singing, startle the dull Night\nFrom his watch-tower in the skies,\nTill the dappled Dawn doth rise;\nThen to come in spite of sorrow,\nAnd at my window bid good-morrow\n120\nThrough the sweetbrier, or the vine,\nOr the twisted eglantine;\nWhile the cock with lively din\nScatters the rear of darkness thin,\nAnd to the stack, or the barn-door,\nStoutly struts his dames before;\nOft listening how the hounds and horn\nCheerly rouse the slumbering Morn,\nFrom the side of some hoar hill,\nThrough the high wood echoing shrill;\nSometime walking, not unseen,\nBy hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,\nRight against the eastern gate,\nWhere the great Sun begins his state,\nRobed in flames and amber light,\nThe clouds in thousand liveries dight,\nWhile the plowman near at hand\nWhistles o'er the furrowed land,\nAnd the milkmaid singing blithe,\nAnd the mower whets his scythe,\nAnd every shepherd tells his tale,\nUnder the hawthorn in the dale.\nTHE SEA\nThe sea, the sea, the open sea,\nThe blue, the fresh, the fever free;\nWithout a mark, without a bound,\nIt runneth the earth's wide regions round;\nIt plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies,\nOr like a cradled creature lies.\nI'm on the sea, I'm on the sea,\nI am where I would ever be,\nWith the blue above and the blue below,\nAnd silence wheresoe'er I go.\nIf a storm should come and awake the deep,\nWhat matter?

If you try re-\npeatedly, it can be sensed by feeling the tongue strike the\nteeth. The entire absence of elastic touch in the voice can be\nobserved in the thick tongue of the intoxicated man. Try to talk\nwith the tongue lying still in the bottom of the mouth, and you\nwill obtain largely the same effect.

A skilled physician can tell much about his patient's\ncondition from the mere sound of the voice. Failing health, or\neven physical weariness, tells through the voice.

In anger it becomes high, harsh, and unpleasant; in love\nlow, soft, and melodious\u2014the variations are as limitless as they\nin a\nare fascinating to observe.

It seems an appalling task to utter articu-\nlately the third-of-a million words that go to make up our Eng-\nlish vocabulary, but the way to make a beginning is really\nsimple: learn to utter correctly, and with easy change from one\nto the other, each of the forty-four elementary sounds in our\nlanguage.\nThe reasons why articulation is so painfully slurred by a\ngreat many public speakers are four: ignorance of the element-\nal sounds; failure to discriminate between sounds nearly alike;\na slovenly, lazy use of the vocal organs; and a torpid will.\nAnyone who is still master of himself will know how to handle\neach of these defects.\nThe vowel sounds are the most vexing source of errors, espe-\ncially where diphthongs are found. Who has not heard such er-\nrors as are hit off in this inimitable verse by Oliver Wendell\nHolmes:\n129\nLearning condemns beyond the reach of hope\nThe careless lips that speak of s?ap for s?ap;\nHer edict exiles from her fair abode\nThe clownish voice that utters r?ad for r?ad;\nLess stern to him who calls his c?at, a c?at\nAnd steers his b?at believing it a b?at.\nShe pardoned one, our classic city's boast.\nWho said at Cambridge, m?st instead of m?st,\nBut knit her brows and stamped her angry foot\nTo hear a Teacher call a r??t a r??t.\nThe foregoing examples are all monosyllables, but bad articu-\nlation is frequently the result of joining sounds that do not be-\nlong together. For example, no one finds it difficult\nto\nsay beauty, but many persist in pronouncing duty as though it\nwere spelled eitherdooty or juty. It is not only from untaught\nspeakers\narticulations\nas colyum for column, and pritty forpretty, but even great\norators occasionally offend quite as unblushingly as less noted\nmortals.\nthat we\nslovenly\nsuch\nhear\nNearly all such are errors of carelessness, not of pure ignor-\nance\u2014of carelessness because the ear never tries to hear what\nthe lips articulate. It must be exasperating to a foreigner to\nfind that the elemental sound ou gives him no hint for the pro-\nnunciation of bough,cough, rough, thorough, and through, and\nwe can well forgive even a man of culture who occasionally\nloses his way amidst the intricacies of English articulation, but\nthere can be no excuse for the slovenly utterance of the simple\nvowel sounds which form at once the life and the beauty of our\nlanguage. He who is too lazy to speak distinctly should hold his\ntongue.\nThe consonant sounds occasion serious trouble only for those\nwho do not look with care at the spelling of words about to be\npronounced. Nothing but carelessness can account for say-\ning Jacop, Babtist, sevem, alwus, or sadisfy.\n\"He that hath yaws to yaw, let him yaw,\" is the rendering\nwhich an Anglophobiac clergyman gave of the familiar scrip-\nture, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" After hearing\nthe name of Sir Humphry Davy pronounced, a Frenchman who\n130\nwished to write to the eminent Englishman thus addressed the\nletter: \"Serum Fridavi.\"\nAccentuation\nAccentuation is the stressing of the proper syllables in\nwords. This it is that is popularly called pronunciation. For in-\nstance, we properly say that a word is mispronounced when it\nis accented in'-viteinstead of in-vite', though it is really an of-\nfense against only one form of pronunciation\u2014accentuation.\nIt is the work of a lifetime to learn the accents of a large\nvocabulary and to keep pace with changing usage; but an alert\near, the study of word-origins, and the dictionary habit, will\nprove to be mighty helpers in a task that can never be finally\ncompleted.\nor\ntwo\nunites\nEnunciation\nCorrect enunciation is the complete utterance of all the\nsounds of a syllable or a word. Wrong articulation gives the\nwrong sound to the vowel or vowels of a word or a syllable,\nas doo for dew;\nimproperly,\nas hully for wholly. Wrong enunciation is the incomplete utter-\nance of a syllable or a word, the sound omitted or added being\nusually consonantal. To sayneedcessity instead of necessity is a\nwrong articulation; to say doin for doing is improper enunci-\nation. The one articulates\u2014that is,\njoints\u2014two sounds that\nshould not be joined, and thus gives the word a positively\nwrong sound; the other fails to touch all the sounds in the\nword, and in that particular way also sounds the word\nincorrectly.\nsounds\n\"My tex' may be foun' in the fif' and six' verses of the secon'\nchapter of Titus; and the subjec' of my discourse is 'The\nGover'ment of ar Homes.'\"6\nWhat did this preacher do with his final consonants?

Lighten\nand\nImperfect enunciation is due to lack of attention and to lazy\nlips. It can be corrected by resolutely attending to the forma-\ntion of syllables as they are uttered. Flexible lips will enunciate\n6.School and College Speaker, Mitchell.\n131\ndifficult combinations of sounds without slighting any of them,\nbut such flexibility cannot be attained except by habitually ut-\ntering words with distinctness and accuracy. A daily exercise\nin enunciating a series of sounds will in a short time give flex-\nibility to the lips and alertness to the mind, so that no word will\nbe uttered without receiving its due complement of sound.\nReturning to our definition, we see that when the sounds of a\nword are properly articulated, the right syllables accented, and\nfull value given to each sound in its enunciation, we have cor-\nrect pronunciation.

I should gorge them with\ngold, I should grant them immunity for their crimes, and\nthey would be grateful. Were I such, the kings we have\nvanquished, far from denouncing Robespierre, would\nlend me their guilty support; there would be a covenant\nbetween them and me. Tyranny must have tools. But the\nenemies of tyranny,\u2014whither does their path tend? To\nthe tomb, and to immortality! What tyrant is my protect-\nor? To what faction do I belong? Yourselves!

What friend of\nthis country would wish to survive the moment when he\ncould no longer serve it,\u2014when he could no longer de-\nfend innocence against oppression? Wherefore should I\ncontinue in an order of things, where intrigue eternally\ntriumphs over truth; where justice is mocked; where pas-\nsions the most abject, or fears the most absurd, over-ride\nthe sacred interests of humanity? In witnessing the mul-\ntitude of vices which the torrent of the Revolution has\nrolled in turbid communion with its civic virtues, I con-\nfess that I have sometimes feared that I should be sul-\nlied, in the eyes of posterity, by the impure neighbor-\nhood of unprincipled men, who had thrust themselves in-\nto association with the sincere friends of humanity; and I\nrejoice that these conspirators against my country have\nnow, by their reckless rage, traced deep the line of de-\nmarcation between themselves and all true men.\nQuestion history, and learn how all the defenders of\nliberty, in all times, have been overwhelmed by calumny.\nBut their traducers died also.

Gesture is an\noutward expression of an inward condition. It is merely an ef-\nfect\u2014the effect of a mental or an emotional impulse struggling\nfor expression through physical avenues.\nYou must not, however, begin at the wrong end: if you are\ntroubled by your gestures, or a lack of gestures, attend to the\ncause, not the effect. It will not in the least help matters to\ntack on to your delivery a few mechanical movements. If the\ntree in your front yard is not growing to suit you, fertilize and\nwater the soil and let the tree have sunshine. Obviously it will\nnot help your tree to nail on a few branches. If your cistern is\ndry, wait until it rains; or bore a well. Why plunge a pump into\na dry hole?\nThe speaker whose thoughts and emotions are welling within\nhim like a mountain spring will not have much trouble to make\ngestures; it will be merely a question of properly directing\nthem. If his enthusiasm for his subject is not such as to give\nhim a natural impulse for dramatic action, it will avail nothing\nto furnish him with a long list of rules. He may tack on some\nmovements, but they will look like the wilted branches nailed\nto a tree to simulate life. Gestures must be born, not built. A\nwooden horse may amuse the children, but it takes a live one\nto go somewhere.\nIt is not only impossible to lay down definite rules on this\nsubject, but it would be silly to try, for everything depends on\n136\nthe speech, the occasion, the personality and feelings of the\nspeaker, and the attitude of the audience. It is easy enough to\nforecast the result of multiplying seven by six, but it is im-\npossible to tell any man what kind of gestures he will be im-\npelled to use when he wishes to show his earnestness. We may\ntell him that many speakers close the hand, with the exception\nof the forefinger, and pointing that finger straight at the audi-\nence pour out their thoughts like a volley; or that others stamp\none foot for emphasis; or that Mr. Bryan often slaps his hands\ntogether for great force, holding one palm upward in an easy\nmanner; or that Gladstone would sometimes make a rush at the\nclerk's table in Parliament and smite it with his hand so force-\nfully that D'israeli once brought down the house by grimly con-\ngratulating himself that such a barrier stood between himself\nand \"the honorable gentleman.\"\nAll these things, and a bookful more, may we tell the speak-\ner, but we cannot know whether he can use these gestures or\nnot, any more than we can decide whether he could wear Mr.\nBryan's clothes. The best that can be done on this subject is to\noffer a few practical suggestions, and let personal good taste\ndecide as to where effective dramatic action ends and extra-\nvagant motion begins.\nAny Gesture That Merely Calls Attention to Itself Is Bad\nThe purpose of a gesture is to carry your thought and feeling\ninto the minds and hearts of your hearers; this it does by em-\nphasizing your message, by interpreting it, by expressing it in\naction, by striking its tone in either a physically descriptive, a\nsuggestive, or a typical gesture\u2014and let it be remembered all\nthe time that gesture includes all physical movement, from fa-\ncial expression and the tossing of the head to the expressive\nmovements of hand and foot. A shifting of the pose may be a\nmost effective gesture.\nWhat is true of gesture is true of all life. If the people on the\nstreet turn around and watch your walk, your walk is more im-\nportant than you are\u2014change it. If the attention of your audi-\nence is called to your gestures, they are not convincing, be-\ncause they appear to be\u2014what they have a doubtful right to be\nin reality\u2014studied. Have you ever seen a speaker use such\ngrotesque gesticulations that you were fascinated by their\nfrenzy of oddity, but could not follow his thought? Do not\n137\nsmother ideas with gymnastics. Savonarola would rush down\nfrom the high pulpit among the congregation in the duomo at\nFlorence and carry the fire of conviction to his hearers; Billy\nSunday slides to base on the platform carpet in dramatizing\none of his baseball illustrations. Yet in both instances the mes-\nsage has somehow stood out bigger than the gesture\u2014it is\nthat men have remembered\nchiefly in calm afterthought\nthe form of dramatic expression. When Sir Henry Irving made\nhis famous exit as \"Shylock\" the last thing the audience saw\nwas his pallid, avaricious hand extended skinny and claw-like\nagainst the background. At the time, every one was over-\nwhelmed by the tremendous typical quality of this gesture;\nnow, we have time to think of its art, and discuss its realistic\npower.\nOnly when gesture is subordinated to the absorbing import-\nance of the idea\u2014a spontaneous, living expression of living\ntruth\u2014is it justifiable at all; and when it is remembered for it-\nself\u2014as a piece of unusual physical energy or as a poem of\ngrace\u2014it is a dead failure as dramatic expression. There is a\nplace for a unique style of walking\u2014it is the circus or the cake-\nwalk; there is a place for surprisingly rhythmical evolutions of\narms and legs\u2014it is on the dance floor or the stage. Don't let\nyour agility and grace put your thoughts out of business.\nOne of the present writers took his first lessons in gesture\nfrom a certain college president who knew far more about\nwhat had happened at the Diet of Worms than he did about\nhow to express himself in action. His instructions were to start\nthe movement on a certain word, continue it on a precise\ncurve, and unfold the fingers at the conclusion, ending with the\nforefinger\u2014just so. Plenty, and more than plenty, has been\npublished on this subject, giving just such silly directions. Ges-\nture is a thing of mentality and feeling\u2014not a matter of geo-\nmetry. Remember, whenever a pair of shoes, a method of pro-\nnunciation, or a gesture calls attention to itself, it is bad. When\nyou have made really good gestures in a good speech your\nhearers will not go away saying, \"What beautiful gestures he\nmade!\" but they will say, \"I'll vote for that measure.\" \"He is\nright\u2014I believe in that.\"\nGestures Should Be Born of the Moment\n138\nThe best actors and public speakers rarely know in advance\nwhat gestures they are going to make. They make one gesture\non certain words tonight, and none at all tomorrow night at the\nsame point\u2014their various moods and interpretations govern\ntheir gestures. It is all a matter of impulse and intelligent feel-\ning with them\u2014don't overlook that word intelligent. Nature\ndoes not always provide the same kind of sunsets or snow\nflakes, and the movements of a good speaker vary almost as\nmuch as the creations of nature.\nfor your gestures.\nNow all this is not to say that you must not take some\nthought\nIf that were meant, why this\nchapter? When the sergeant despairingly besought the recruit\nin the awkward squad to step out and look at himself, he gave\nsplendid advice\u2014and worthy of personal application. Particu-\nlarly while you are in the learning days of public speaking you\nmust learn to criticise your own gestures. Recall them\u2014see\nwhere they were useless, crude, awkward, what not, and do\nbetter next time. There is a vast deal of difference between be-\ning conscious of self and being self-conscious.\nIt will require your nice discrimination in order to cultivate\nspontaneous gestures and yet give due attention to practise.\nWhile you depend upon the moment it is vital to remember that\nonly a dramatic genius can effectively accomplish such feats as\nwe have related of Whitefield, Savonarola, and others: and\ndoubtless the first time they were used they came in a burst of\nspontaneous feeling, yet Whitefield declared that not until he\nhad delivered a sermon forty times was its delivery perfected.\nWhat spontaneity initiates let practise complete. Every effect-\nive speaker and every vivid actor has observed, considered and\npractised gesture until his dramatic actions are a sub-con-\nscious possession, just like his ability to pronounce correctly\nwithout especially concentrating his thought. Every able plat-\nform man has possessed himself of a dozen ways in which he\nmight depict in gesture any given emotion; in fact, the means\nfor such expression are endless\u2014and this is precisely why it is\nboth useless and harmful to make a chart of gestures and en-\nforce them as the ideals of what may be used to express this or\nthat feeling. Practise descriptive, suggestive, and typical move-\nments until they come as naturally as a good articulation; and\n139\nrarely forecast the gestures you will use at a given moment:\nleave something to that moment.\nAvoid Monotony in Gesture\nRoast beef is an excellent dish, but it would be terrible as an\nexclusive diet. No matter how effective one gesture is, do not\noverwork it. Put variety in your actions. Monotony will destroy\nall beauty and power. The pump handle makes one effective\ngesture, and on hot days that one is very eloquent, but it has\nits limitations.\nAny Movement that is not Significant, Weakens\nDo not forget that. Restlessness is not expression. A great\nmany useless movements will only take the attention of the\naudience from what you are saying. A widely-noted man intro-\nduced the speaker of the evening one Sunday lately to a New\nYork audience. The only thing remembered about that intro-\nductory speech is that the speaker played nervously with the\ncovering of the table as he talked. We naturally watch moving\nobjects. A janitor putting down a window can take the attention\nof the hearers from Mr. Roosevelt. By making a few move-\nments at one side of the stage a chorus girl may draw the in-\nterest of the spectators from a big scene between the \"leads.\"\nWhen our forefathers lived in caves they had to watch moving\nobjects, for movements meant danger. We have not yet over-\ncome the habit. Advertisers have taken advantage of it\u2014wit-\nness the moving electric light signs in any city. A shrewd\nspeaker will respect this law and conserve the attention of his\naudience by eliminating all unnecessary movements.\nGesture Should either be Simultaneous with or Precede the\nWords\u2014not Follow Them\nLady Macbeth says: \"Bear welcome in your eye, your hand,\nyour tongue.\" Reverse this order and you get comedy. Say,\n\"There he goes,\" pointing at him after you have finished your\nwords, and see if the result is not comical.\nDo Not Make Short, Jerky Movements\nSome speakers seem to be imitating a waiter who has failed\nto get a tip. Let your movements be easy, and from the\nshoulder, as a rule, rather than from the elbow. But do not go\nto the other extreme and make too many flowing motions\u2014that\nsavors of the lackadaisical.\n140\nPut a little \"punch\" and life into your gestures. You can not,\nhowever, do this mechanically. The audience will detect it if\nyou do. They may not know just what is wrong, but the gesture\nwill have a false appearance to them.\nFacial Expression is Important\nHave you ever stopped in front of a Broadway theater and\nlooked at the photographs of the cast? Notice the row of chor-\nus girls who are supposed to be expressing fear. Their atti-\ntudes are so mechanical that the attempt is ridiculous. Notice\nthe picture of the \"star\" expressing the same emotion: his\nmuscles are drawn, his eyebrows lifted, he shrinks, and fear\nshines through his eyes. That actor feltfear when the photo-\ngraph was taken. The chorus girls felt that it was time for a\nrarebit, and more nearly expressed that emotion than they did\nfear. Incidentally, that is one reason why they stay in the\nchorus.\nThe movements of the facial muscles may mean a great deal\nmore than the movements of the hand. The man who sits in a\ndejected heap with a look of despair on his face is expressing\nhis thoughts and feelings just as effectively as the man who is\nwaving his arms and shouting from the back of a dray wagon.\nThe eye has been called the window of the soul. Through it\nshines the light of our thoughts and feelings.\nDo Not Use Too Much Gesture\nAs a matter of fact, in the big crises of life we do not go\nthrough many actions. When your closest friend dies you do\nnot throw up your hands and talk about your grief. You are\nmore likely to sit and brood in dry-eyed silence. The Hudson\nRiver does not make much noise on its way to the sea\u2014it is not\nhalf so loud as the little creek up in Bronx Park that a bullfrog\ntears your\ncould leap across. The barking dog never\ntrousers\u2014at least they say he doesn't. Do not fear the man who\nwaves his arms and shouts his anger, but the man who comes\nup quietly with eyes flaming and face burning may knock you\ndown. Fuss is not force. Observe these principles in nature and\npractise them in your delivery.\nThe writer of this chapter once observed an instructor\ndrilling a class in gesture. They had come to the passage from\nHenry VIII in which the humbled Cardinal says: \"Farewell, a\nlong farewell to all my greatness.\" It is one of the pathetic\n141\npassages of literature. A man uttering such a sentiment would\nbe crushed, and the last thing on earth he would do would be\nto make flamboyant movements. Yet this class had an elocu-\ntionary manual before them that gave an appropriate gesture\nfor every occasion, from paying the gas bill to death-bed\nfarewells. So they were instructed to throw their arms out at\nfull length on each side and say: \"Farewell, a long farewell to\nall my greatness.\" Such a gesture might possibly be used in an\nafter-dinner speech at the convention of a telephone company\nwhose lines extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but to\nthink of Wolsey's using that movement would suggest that his\nfate was just.\nPosture\nThe physical attitude to be taken before the audience really\nis included in gesture. Just what that attitude should be de-\npends, not on rules, but on the spirit of the speech and the oc-\ncasion. Senator La Follette stood for three hours with his\nweight thrown on his forward foot as he leaned out over the\nfootlights, ran his fingers through his hair, and flamed out a\ndenunciation of the trusts. It was very effective. But imagine a\nspeaker taking that kind of position to discourse on the devel-\nopment of road-making machinery. If you have a fiery, aggress-\nive message, and will let yourself go, nature will naturally pull\nyour weight to your forward foot. A man in a hot political argu-\nment or a street brawl never has to stop to think upon which\nfoot he should throw his weight. You may sometimes place\nyour weight on your back foot if you have a restful and calm\nmessage\u2014but don't worry about it: just stand like a man who\ngenuinely feels what he is saying. Do not stand with your heels\nclose together, like a soldier or a butler. No more should you\nstand with them wide apart like a traffic policeman. Use simple\ngood manners and common sense.\nHere a word of caution is needed. We have advised you to al-\nlow your gestures and postures to be spontaneous and not\nwoodenly prepared beforehand, but do not go to the extreme of\nignoring the importance of acquiring mastery of your physical\nmovements. A muscular hand made flexible by free movement,\nis far more likely to be an effective instrument in gesture than\na stiff, pudgy bunch of fingers. If your shoulders are lithe and\ncarried well, while your chest does not retreat from association\n142\nwith your chin, the chances of using good extemporaneous ges-\ntures are so much the better. Learn to keep the back of your\nneck touching your collar, hold your chest high, and keep down\nyour waist measure.\nSo attention to strength, poise, flexibility, and grace of body\nare the foundations of good gesture, for they are expressions of\nvitality, and without vitality no speaker can enter the kingdom\nof power. When an awkward giant like Abraham Lincoln rose\nto the sublimest heights of oratory he did so because of the\ngreatness of his soul\u2014his very ruggedness of spirit and artless\nhonesty were properly expressed in his gnarly body. The fire of\ncharacter, of earnestness, and of message swept his hearers\nbefore him when the tepid words of an insincere Apollo would\nhave left no effect. But be sure you are a second Lincoln before\nyou despise the handicap of physical awkwardness.\n\"Ty\" Cobb has confided to the public that when he is in a bat-\nting slump he even stands before a mirror, bat in hand, to ob-\nserve the \"swing\" and \"follow through\" of his batting form. If\nyou would learn to stand well before an audience, look at your-\nself in a mirror\u2014but not too often. Practise walking and stand-\ning before the mirror so as to conquer awkwardness\u2014not to\ncultivate a pose. Stand on the platform in the same easy man-\nner that you would use before guests in a drawing-room. If\nyour position is not graceful, make it so by dancing, gymnasi-\num work, and by getting grace and poise in your mind.\nDo not continually hold the same position. Any big change of\nthought necessitates a change of position. Be at home. There\nare no rules\u2014it is all a matter of taste. While on the platform\nforget\nthat you have any hands until you desire to use\nthem\u2014then remember them effectively. Gravity will take care\nof them. Of course, if you want to put them behind you, or fold\nthem once in awhile,\nit is not going to ruin your speech.\nThought and feeling are the big things in speaking\u2014not the po-\nsition of a foot or a hand. Simply put your limbs where you\nwant them to be\u2014you have a will, so do not neglect to use it.\nLet us reiterate, do not despise practise. Your gestures and\nmovements may be spontaneous and still be wrong. No matter\nhow natural they are, it is possible to improve them.\nIt is impossible for anyone\u2014even yourself\u2014to criticise your\ngestures until after they are made. You can't prune a peach\n143\ntree until it comes up; therefore speak much, and observe your\nown speech. While you are examining yourself, do not forget to\nstudy statuary and paintings to see how the great portrayers of\nnature have made their subjects express ideas through action.\nNotice the gestures of the best speakers and actors. Observe\nthe physical expression of life everywhere. The leaves on the\ntree respond to the slightest breeze. The muscles of your face,\nthe light of your eyes, should respond to the slightest change\nof feeling. Emerson says: \"Every man that I meet is my superi-\nor in some way. In that I learn of him.\" Illiterate Italians make\ngestures so wonderful and beautiful that Booth or Barrett\nmight have sat at their feet and been instructed. Open your\neyes. Emerson says again: \"We are immersed in beauty, but\nour eyes have no clear vision.\" Toss this book to one side; go\nout and watch one child plead with another for a bite of apple;\nsee a street brawl; observe life in action. Do you want to know\nhow to express victory? Watch the victors' hands go high on\nelection night. Do you want to plead a cause? Make a compos-\nite photograph of all the pleaders in daily life you constantly\nsee. Beg, borrow, and steal the best you can get, BUT DON'T\nGIVE IT OUT AS THEFT. Assimilate it until it becomes a part of\nyou\u2014then let the expression come out.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. From what source do you intend to study gesture?\n2.

Read aloud the following incident, using dramatic\ngestures:\nWhen Voltaire was preparing a young actress to appear\nin one of his tragedies, he tied her hands to her sides\nwith pack thread in order to check her tendency toward\nexuberant gesticulation. Under this condition of com-\npulsory immobility she commenced to rehearse, and for\nsome time she bore herself calmly enough; but at last,\ncompletely carried away by her feelings, she burst her\n145\nbonds and flung up her arms. Alarmed at her supposed\nneglect of his instructions, she began to apologize to the\npoet; he smilingly reassured her, however; the gesture\nwas then admirable, because it was irrepressible.\u2014Red-\nway, The Actor's Art.\n23. Render the following with suitable gestures:\nOne day, while preaching, Whitefield \"suddenly assumed\na nautical air and manner that were irresistible with\nhim,\" and broke forth in these words: \"Well, my boys, we\nhave a clear sky, and are making fine headway over a\nsmooth sea before a light breeze, and we shall soon lose\nsight of land. But what means this sudden lowering of\nthe heavens, and that dark cloud arising from beneath\nthe western horizon? Hark! Don't you hear distant thun-\nder? Don't you see those flashes of lightning? There is a\nstorm gathering! Every man to his duty! The air is\ndark!\u2014the tempest rages!\u2014our masts are gone!\u2014the\nship is on her beam ends! What next?\" At this a number\nof sailors in the congregation, utterly swept away by the\ndramatic description, leaped to their feet and cried: \"The\nlongboat!\u2014take to the longboat!\"\n\u2014Nathan Sheppard, Before an Audience.\n146\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 15\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT GESTURE\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "The crown, the consummation, of the discourse is its de-\nlivery.

However, it is worth while warning you not to\nbe lenient\nin self-exaction. Say to yourself courageously:\nWhat others can do, I can attempt. A bold spirit conquers\nwhere others flinch, and a trying task challenges pluck.\n147\nReading from Manuscript\nThis method really deserves short shrift in a book on public\nspeaking, for, delude yourself as you may, public reading is not\npublic speaking. Yet there are so many who grasp this broken\nreed for support\nthat we must here discuss the \"read\nspeech\"\u2014apologetic misnomer as it is.\nCertainly there are occasions\u2014among them, the opening of\nCongress, the presentation of a sore question before a deliber-\native body, or a historical commemoration\u2014when it may seem\nnot alone to the \"orator\" but to all those interested that the\nchief thing is to express certain thoughts in precise lan-\nguage\u2014in language that must not be either misunderstood or\nmisquoted. At such times oratory is unhappily elbowed to a\nback bench, the manuscript is solemnly withdrawn from the ca-\npacious inner pocket of the new frock coat, and everyone\nsettles himself resignedly, with only a feeble flicker of hope\nthat the so-called speech may not be as long as it is thick. The\nwords may be golden, but the hearers' (?) eyes are prone to be\nleaden, and in about one instance out of a hundred does the\nperpetrator really deliver an impressive address. His excuse is\nhis apology\u2014he is not to be blamed, as a rule, for some one de-\ncreed that it would be dangerous to cut loose from manuscript\nmoorings and take his audience with him on a really delightful\nsail.\nOne great trouble on such \"great occasions\" is that the es-\nsayist\u2014for such he is\u2014has been chosen not because of his\nspeaking ability but because his grandfather fought in a cer-\ntain battle, or his constituents sent him to Congress, or his\ngifts in some line of endeavor other than speaking have distin-\nguished him.\nAs well choose a surgeon from his ability to play golf. To be\nsure, it always interests an audience to see a great man; be-\ncause of his eminence they are likely to listen to his words with\nrespect, perhaps with interest, even when droned from a\nmanuscript. But how much more effective such a deliverance\nwould be if the papers were cast aside!\nNowhere is the read-address so common as in the pulpit\u2014the\npulpit, that in these days least of all can afford to invite a han-\ndicap. Doubtless many clergymen prefer finish to fervor\u2014let\nthem choose: they are rarely men who sway the masses to\n148\nacceptance of their message. What they gain in precision and\nelegance of language they lose in force.\nThere are just four motives that can move a man to read his\naddress or sermon:\n1. Laziness is the commonest. Enough said. Even Heaven\ncannot make a lazy man efficient.\n2. A memory so defective that he really cannot speak without\nreading. Alas, he is not speaking when he is reading, so his di-\nlemma is painful\u2014and not to himself alone. But no man has a\nright to assume that his memory is utterly bad until he has\nbuckled down to memory culture\u2014and failed. A weak memory\nis oftener an excuse than a reason.\n3. A genuine lack of time to do more than write the speech.\nThere are such instances\u2014but they do not occur every week!\nThe disposition of your time allows more flexibility than you\nrealize. Motive 3 too often harnesses up with Motive 1.\n4. A conviction that the speech is too important to risk for-\nsaking the manuscript. But, if it is vital that every word should\nbe so precise, the style so polished, and the thoughts so logical,\nthat the preacher must write the sermon entire, is not the mes-\nsage important enough to warrant extra effort in perfecting its\ndelivery? It is an insult to a congregation and disrespectful to\nAlmighty God to put the phrasing of a message above the mes-\nsage itself. To reach the hearts of the hearers the sermon must\nbe delivered\u2014it is only half delivered when the speaker cannot\nutter it with original fire and force, when he merely repeats\nwords that were conceived hours or weeks before and hence\nits fizz. The reading\nare like champagne that has lost\npreacher's eyes are tied down to his manuscript; he cannot\ngive the audience the benefit of his expression. How long\nwould a play fill a theater if the actors held their cue-books in\nhand and read their parts? Imagine Patrick Henry reading his\nfamous speech; Peter-the-Hermit, manuscript in hand, exhort-\ning the crusaders; Napoleon, constantly looking at his papers,\naddressing the army at the Pyramids; or Jesus reading the Ser-\nmon on the Mount! These speakers were so full of their sub-\njects, their general preparation had been so richly adequate,\nthat there was no necessity for a manuscript, either to refer to\nor to serve as \"an outward and visible sign\" of their prepared-\nrequired\nness. No event was ever so dignified that\nit\n149\nan artificial attempt at speech making. Call an essay by\nits right name, but never call it a speech. Perhaps the most dig-\nnified of events is a supplication to the Creator. If you ever\nlistened to the reading of an original prayer you must have felt\nits superficiality.\nRegardless of what the theories may be about manuscript de-\nlivery, the fact remains that it does not work out with effi-\nciency. Avoid it whenever at all possible.\nCommitting the Written Speech and Speaking from Memory\nThis method has certain points in its favor. If you have time\nand leisure, it is possible to polish and rewrite your ideas until\nthey are expressed in clear, concise terms. Pope sometimes\nspent a whole day in perfecting one couplet. Gibbon consumed\ntwenty years gathering material for and rewriting the \"Decline\nand Fall of the Roman Empire.\" Although you cannot devote\nsuch painstaking preparation to a speech, you should take time\nto eliminate useless words, crowd whole paragraphs into a sen-\ntence and choose proper illustrations. Good speeches,\nlike\nplays, are not written; they are rewritten. The National Cash\nRegister Company follows this plan with their most efficient\nselling organization: they require their salesmen to memorize\nverbatim a selling talk. They maintain that there is one best\nway of putting their selling arguments, and they insist that\neach salesman use this ideal way rather than employ any\nthe\nhaphazard phrases that may come into his mind at\nmoment.\nThe method of writing and committing has been adopted by\nmany noted speakers; Julius C\u00e6sar, Robert Ingersoll, and, on\nsome occasions, Wendell Phillips, were distinguished ex-\namples. The wonderful effects achieved by famous actors were,\nof course, accomplished through the delivery of memorized\nlines.\nThe inexperienced speaker must be warned before attempt-\ning this method of delivery that it is difficult and trying. It re-\nquires much skill to make it efficient. The memorized lines of\nthe young speaker will usually sound like memorized words,\nand repel.\nIf you want to hear an example, listen to a department store\ndemonstrator repeat her memorized lingo about the newest\nfurniture polish or breakfast food. It requires training to make\n150\na memorized speech sound fresh and spontaneous, and, unless\nyou have a fine native memory, in each instance the finished\nproduct necessitates much labor. Should you forget a part of\nyour speech or miss a few words, you are liable to be so con-\nfused that, like Mark Twain's guide in Rome, you will be com-\npelled to repeat your lines from the beginning.\nOn the other hand, you may be so taken up with trying to re-\ncall your written words that you will not abandon yourself to\nthe spirit of your address, and so fail to deliver it with that\nspontaneity which is so vital to forceful delivery.\nBut do not let these difficulties frighten you. If committing\nseems best to you, give it a faithful trial. Do not be deterred by\nits pitfalls, but by resolute practise avoid them.\nOne of the best ways to rise superior to these difficulties is to\ndo as Dr. Wallace Radcliffe often does: commit without writing\nthe speech, making practically all the preparation mentally,\nwithout putting pen to paper\u2014a laborious but effective way of\ncultivating both mind and memory.\nYou will find it excellent practise, both for memory and deliv-\nery, to commit the specimen speeches found in this volume and\ndeclaim them, with all attention to the principles we have put\nbefore you. William Ellery Channing, himself a distinguished\nspeaker, years ago had this to say of practise in declamation:\n\"Is there not an amusement, having an affinity with the\ndrama, which might be usefully introduced among us? I mean,\nRecitation. A work of genius, recited by a man of fine taste, en-\nthusiasm, and powers of elocution, is a very pure and high\ngratification. Were this art cultivated and encouraged, great\nnumbers, now insensible to the most beautiful compositions,\nmight be waked up to their excellence and power.\"\nSpeaking from Notes\nThe third, and the most popular method of delivery, is prob-\nably also the best one for the beginner. Speaking from notes is\nnot ideal delivery, but we learn to swim in shallow water be-\nfore going out beyond the ropes.\nMake a definite plan for your discourse (for a fuller discus-\nsion see Chapter XVIII) and set down the points somewhat in\nthe fashion of a lawyer's brief, or a preacher's outline. Here is\na sample of very simple notes:\n151\nATTENTION\nI. Introduction.\nAttention indispensable to the performance of any great\nwork. Anecdote.\nII. Defined And Illustrated.\n1. From common observation.\n2. From the lives of great men {Carlyle, Robert E. Lee.\nIII. Its Relation To Other Mental Powers.\n1. Reason.\n2. Imagination.\n3. Memory.\n4. Will. Anecdote.\nIV. Attention May Be Cultivated.\n1. Involuntary attention.\n2. Voluntary attention. Examples.\nV. Conclusion.\nThe consequences of inattention and of attention.\nFew briefs would be so precise as this one, for with experi-\nence a speaker learns to use little tricks to attract his eye\u2014he\nmay underscore a catch-word heavily, draw a red circle around\na pivotal idea, enclose the key-word of an anecdote in a wavy-\nlined box, and so on indefinitely. These points are worth re-\nmembering, for nothing so eludes the swift-glancing eye of the\nspeaker as the sameness of typewriting, or even a regular pen-\nscript. So unintentional a thing as a blot on the page may help\nyou to remember a big \"point\" in your brief\u2014perhaps by associ-\nation of ideas.\nAn inexperienced speaker would probably require fuller\nnotes than the specimen given. Yet that way lies danger, for\nthe complete manuscript is but a short remove from the copi-\nous outline. Use as few notes as possible.\nThey may be necessary for the time being, but do not fail to\nlook upon them as a necessary evil; and even when you lay\nthem before you, refer to them only when compelled to do so.\nMake your notes as full as you please in preparation, but by all\nmeans condense them for platform use.\nExtemporaneous Speech\n152\nSurely this is the ideal method of delivery. It is far and away\nthe most popular with the audience, and the favorite method of\nthe most efficient speakers.\n\"Extemporaneous speech\" has sometimes been made to\nmean unprepared speech, and indeed it is too often precisely\nthat; but in no such sense do we recommend it strongly to\nspeakers old and young. On the contrary, to speak well without\nnotes requires all the preparation which we discussed so fully\nin the chapter on \"Fluency,\" while yet relying upon the \"inspir-\nation of the hour\" for some of your thoughts and much of your\nlanguage. You had better remember, however, that the most\neffective inspiration of the hour is the inspiration you yourself\nbring to it, bottled up in your spirit and ready to infuse itself in-\nto the audience.\nIf you extemporize you can get much closer to your audience.\nIn a sense, they appreciate the task you have before you and\nsend out their sympathy. Extemporize, and you will not have to\nstop and fumble around amidst your notes\u2014you can keep your\neye afire with your message and hold your audience with your\nvery glance. You yourself will feel their response as you read\nthe effects of your warm, spontaneous words, written on their\ncountenances.\nSentences written out in the study are liable to be dead and\ncold when resurrected before the audience. When you create\nas you speak you conserve all the native fire of your thought.\nYou can enlarge on one point or omit another, just as the occa-\nsion or the mood of the audience may demand. It is not pos-\nsible for every speaker to use this, the most difficult of all\nmethods of delivery, and least of all can it be used successfully\nwithout much practise, but it is the ideal towards which all\nshould strive.\nOne danger in this method is that you may be led aside from\nyour subject into by-paths. To avoid this peril, firmly stick to\nyour mental outline. Practise speaking from a memorized brief\nuntil you gain control. Join a debating society\u2014talk, talk, TALK,\nand always extemporize. You may \"make a fool of yourself\"\nonce or twice, but is that too great a price to pay for success?\nNotes, like crutches, are only a sign of weakness. Remember\nthat the power of your speech depends to some extent upon\nthe view your audience holds of you. General Grant's words as\n153\npresident were more powerful than his words as a Missouri\nfarmer. If you would appear in the light of an authority, be one.\nMake notes on your brain instead of on paper.\nJoint Methods of Delivery\nA modification of the second method has been adopted by\nmany great speakers, particularly lecturers who are compelled\nto speak on a wide variety of subjects day after day; such\nspeakers often commit their addresses to memory but keep\ntheir manuscripts in flexible book form before them, turning\nseveral pages at a time. They feel safer for having a sheet-an-\nchor to windward\u2014but it is an anchor, nevertheless, and\nhinders rapid, free sailing, though it drag never so lightly.\nOther speakers throw out a still lighter anchor by keeping\nbefore them a rather full outline of their written and commit-\nted speech.\nOthers again write and commit a few important parts of the\naddress\u2014the introduction, the conclusion, some vital argu-\nment, some pat illustration\u2014and depend on the hour for the\nlanguage of the rest. This method is well adapted to speaking\neither with or without notes.\nSome speakers read from manuscript the most important\nparts of their speeches and utter the rest extemporaneously.\nThus, what we have called \"joint methods of delivery\" are\nopen to much personal variation. You must decide for yourself\nwhich is best for you, for the occasion, for your subject, for\nyour audience\u2014for these four factors all have their individual\nclaims.\nWhatever form you choose, do not be so weakly indifferent as\nto prefer the easy way\u2014choose the best way, whatever it cost\nyou in time and effort. And of this be assured: only the prac-\ntised speaker can hope to gain both conciseness of argument\nand conviction in manner, polish of language and power in de-\nlivery, finish of style and fire in utterance.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Which in your judgment is the most suitable of delivery for\nyou? Why?\n2. What objections can you offer to, (a) memorizing the entire\nspeech; (b) reading from manuscript; (c) using notes; (d)\n154\nspeaking from memorized outline or notes; (ee) any of the\n\"joint methods\"?\n3. What is there to commend in delivering a speech in any of\nthe foregoing methods?\n4. Can you suggest any combination of methods that you\nhave found efficacious?\n5. What methods, according to your observation, do most\nsuccessful speakers use?\n6. Select some topic from the list on page 123, narrow the\ntheme so as to make it specific (see page 122), and deliver a\nshort address, utilizing the four methods mentioned, in four\ndifferent deliveries of the speech.\n7. Select one of the joint methods and apply it to the delivery\nof the same address.\n8. Which method do you prefer, and why?\n9. From the list of subjects in the Appendix select a theme\nand deliver a five-minute address without notes, but make\ncareful preparation without putting your thoughts on paper.\nNOTE: It is earnestly hoped that instructors will not pass this\nstage of the work without requiring of their students much\npractise in the delivery of original speeches, in the manner that\nto be best suited to the\nseems, after some experiment,\nstudent's gifts. Students who are studying alone should be\nequally exacting in demand upon themselves. One point is most\nimportant: It is easy to learn to read a speech, therefore it is\nmuch more urgent that the pupil should have much practise in\nspeaking from notes and speaking without notes. At this stage,\npay more attention to manner than to matter\u2014the succeeding\nchapters take up the composition of the address. Be particu-\nlarly insistent upon frequent and thorough review of the prin-\nciples of delivery discussed in the preceding chapters.\n155\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 16\nMETHODS OF DELIVERY\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Providence is always on the side of the last reserve.\n\u2014Napoleon Bonaparte.\nSo mightiest powers by deepest calms are fed,\nAnd sleep, how oft, in things that gentlest be!\n\u2014Barry Cornwall, The Sea in Calm.\nWhat would happen if you should overdraw your bank ac-\ncount?

It is as reckless for a speaker to risk\ngoing before an audience without having something in reserve\nas it is for the motorist to essay a long journey in the wilds\nwithout enough gasoline in sight.\nBut in what does a speaker's reserve power consist? In a\nwell-founded reliance on his general and particular grasp of his\nsubject;\nin\nthought\u2014particularly in the ability to think while on his feet;\nand in that self-possession which makes one the captain of all\nhis own forces, bodily and mental.\nin the quality of being alert and resourceful\nThe first of these elements, adequate preparation, and the\nlast, self-reliance, were discussed fully in the chapters on \"Self-\nConfidence\" and \"Fluency,\" so they will be touched only incid-\nentally here; besides, the next chapter will take up specific\nmethods of preparation for public speaking. Therefore the\ncentral theme of this chapter is the second of the elements of\nreserve power\u2014Thought.\nThe Mental Storehouse\n156\nAn empty mind, like an empty larder, may be a serious mat-\nter or not\u2014all will depend on the available resources. If there\nis no food in the cupboard the housewife does not nervously\nrattle the empty dishes; she telephones the grocer. If you have\nno ideas, do not rattle your empty ers and ahs, but get some\nideas, and don't speak until you do get them.\nThis, however, is not being what the old New England house-\nkeeper used to call \"forehanded.\" The real solution of the prob-\nlem of what to do with an empty head is never to let it become\nempty. In the artesian wells of Dakota the water rushes to the\nsurface and leaps a score of feet above the ground. The secret\nof this exuberant flow is of course the great supply below,\ncrowding to get out.\nWhat is the use of stopping to prime a mental pump when\nyou can fill your life with the resources for an artesian well? It\nis not enough to have merely enough; you must have more than\nenough. Then the pressure of your mass of thought and feeling\nwill maintain your flow of speech and give you the confidence\nand poise that denote reserve power. To be away from home\nwith only the exact return fare leaves a great deal\nto\ncircumstances!\nReserve power is magnetic. It does not consist in giving the\nidea that you are holding something in reserve, but rather in\nthe suggestion that the audience is getting the cream of your\nobservation, reading, experience, feeling, thought. To have re-\nserve power, therefore, you must have enough milk of material\non hand to supply sufficient cream.\nBut how shall we get the milk? There are two ways: the one\nis first-hand\u2014from the cow; the other is second-hand\u2014from the\nmilkman.\nThe Seeing Eye\nSome sage has said: \"For a thousand men who can speak,\nthere is only one who can think; for a thousand men who can\nthink, there is only one who can see.\" To see and to think is to\nget your milk from your own cow.\nWhen the one man in a million who can see comes along, we\ncall him Master. Old Mr. Holbrook, of \"Cranford,\" asked his\nguest what color ash-buds were in March; she confessed she\ndid not know, to which the old gentleman answered: \"I knew\nyou didn't. No more did I\u2014an old fool that I am!\u2014till this young\n157\nman comes and tells me. 'Black as ash-buds in March.' And I've\nlived all my life in the country. More shame for me not to know.\nBlack; they are jet-black, madam.\"\n\"This young man\" referred to by Mr. Holbrook was Tennyson.\nHenry Ward Beecher said: \"I do not believe that I have ever\nmet a man on the street that I did not get from him some ele-\nment for a sermon. I never see anything in nature which does\nnot work towards that for which I give the strength of my life.\nThe material for my sermons is all the time following me and\nswarming up around me.\"\nInstead of saying only one man in a million can see, it would\nstrike nearer the truth to say that none of us sees with perfect\nunderstanding more than a fraction of what passes before our\neyes, yet this faculty of acute and accurate observation is so\nimportant that no man ambitious to lead can neglect it. The\nnext time you are in a car, look at those who sit opposite you\nand see what you can discover of their habits, occupations,\nideals, nationalities, environments, education, and so on. You\nmay not see a great deal the first time, but practise will reveal\nastonishing results. Transmute every incident of your day into\na subject for a speech or an illustration. Translate all that you\nsee into terms of speech. When you can describe all that you\nhave seen in definite words, you are seeing clearly. You are be-\ncoming the millionth man.\nDe Maupassant's description of an author should also fit the\npublic-speaker: \"His eye is like a suction pump, absorbing\neverything; like a pickpocket's hand, always at work. Nothing\nescapes him. He is constantly collecting material, gathering-up\nglances, gestures, intentions, everything that goes on in his\npresence\u2014the slightest look, the least act, the merest trifle.\"\nDe Maupassant was himself a millionth man, a Master.\n\"Ruskin took a common rock-crystal and saw hidden within\nits stolid heart lessons which have not yet ceased to move\nmen's lives. Beecher stood for hours before the window of a\njewelry store thinking out analogies between jewels and the\nsouls of men. Gough saw in a single drop of water enough truth\nwherewith to quench the thirst of five thousand souls. Thoreau\nsat so still in the shadowy woods that birds and insects came\nand opened up their secret lives to his eye. Emerson observed\nthe soul of a man so long that at length he could say, 'I cannot\n158\nhear what you say, for seeing what you are.' Preyer for three\nyears studied the life of his babe and so became an authority\nupon the child mind. Observation! Most men are blind. There\nare a thousand times as many hidden truths and undiscovered\nfacts about us to-day as have made discoverers famous\u2014facts\nwaiting for some one to 'pluck out the heart of their mystery.'\nBut so long as men go about the search with eyes that see not,\nso long will these hidden pearls lie in their shells. Not an\norator but who could more effectively point and feather his\nshafts were he to search nature rather than libraries. Too few\ncan see 'sermons in stones' and 'books in the running brooks,'\nbecause they are so used to seeing merely sermons in books\nand only stones in running brooks. Sir Philip Sidney had a say-\ning, 'Look in thy heart and write;' Massillon explained his as-\ntute knowledge of the human heart by saying, 'I learned it by\nstudying myself;' Byron says of John Locke that 'all his know-\nledge of the human understanding was derived from studying\nhis own mind.' Since multiform nature is all about us, original-\nity ought not to be so rare.\"8\nThe Thinking Mind\nThinking is doing mental arithmetic with facts. Add this fact\nto that and you reach a certain conclusion. Subtract this truth\nfrom another and you have a definite result. Multiply this fact\nby another and have a precise product. See how many times\nthis occurrence happens in that space of time and you have\nreached a calculable dividend. In thought-processes you per-\nform every known problem of arithmetic and algebra. That is\nwhy mathematics are such excellent mental gymnastics. But by\nthe same token, thinking is work. Thinking takes energy.\nThinking requires time, and patience, and broad information,\nand clearheadedness. Beyond a miserable little surface-\nscratching, few people really think at all\u2014only one in a thou-\nsand, according to the pundit already quoted. So long as the\npresent system of education prevails and children are taught\nthrough the ear rather than through the eye, so long as they\nare expected to remember thoughts of others rather than think\nfor themselves, this proportion will continue\u2014one man in a mil-\nlion will be able to see, and one in a thousand to think.\n8.How to Attract and Hold an Audience, J. Berg Esenwein.\n159\nBut, however thought-less a mind has been, there is promise\nof better things so soon as the mind detects its own lack of\nthought-power. The first step is to stop regarding thought as\n\"the magic of the mind,\" to use Byron's expression, and see it\nas thought truly is\u2014a weighing of ideas and a placing of them\nin relationships to each other. Ponder this definition and see if\nyou have learned to think efficiently.\nHabitual thinking is just that\u2014a habit. Habit comes of doing\na thing repeatedly. The lower habits are acquired easily, the\nhigher ones require deeper grooves if they are to persist. So\nwe find that the thought-habit comes only with resolute prac-\ntise; yet no effort will yield richer dividends. Persist in practise,\nand whereas you have been able to think only an inch-deep in-\nto a subject, you will soon find that you can penetrate it a foot.\nPerhaps this homely metaphor will suggest how to begin the\npractise of consecutive thinking, by which we mean welding a\nnumber of separate thought-links into a chain that will hold.\nTake one link at a time, see that each naturally belongs with\nthe ones you link to it, and remember that a single missing link\nmeans no chain.\nThinking is the most fascinating and exhilarating of all men-\ntal exercises. Once realize that your opinion on a subject does\nnot represent the choice you have made between what Dr.\nCerebrum has written and Professor Cerebellum has said, but\nis the result of your own earnestly-applied brain-energy, and\nyou will gain a confidence in your ability to speak on that sub-\nject that nothing will be able to shake. Your thought will have\ngiven you both power and reserve power.\nSomeone has condensed the relation of thought to know-\nledge in these pungent, homely lines:\n\"Don't give me the man who thinks he thinks,\nDon't give me the man who thinks he knows,\nBut give me the man who knows he thinks,\nAnd I have the man who knows he knows!\"\nReading As a Stimulus to Thought\nNo matter how dry the cow, however, nor how poor our abil-\nity to milk, there is still the milkman\u2014we can read what others\nhave seen and felt and thought. Often, indeed, such records\n160\nwill kindle within us that pre-essential and vital spark,\nthe desire to be a thinker.\nThe following selection is taken from one of Dr. Newell\nDwight Hillis's lectures, as given in \"A Man's Value to Society.\"\nDr. Hillis is a most fluent speaker\u2014he never refers to notes. He\nhas reserve power. His mind is a veritable treasure-house of\nfacts and ideas. See how he draws from a knowledge of fifteen\ndifferent general or special subjects: geology, plant\nlife,\nPalestine, chemistry, Eskimos, mythology, literature, The Nile,\nhistory, law, wit, evolution, religion, biography, and electricity.\nSurely, it needs no sage to discover that the secret of this\nman's reserve power is the old secret of our artesian well\nwhose abundance surges from unseen depths.\nTHE USES OF BOOKS AND READING9\nEach Kingsley approaches a stone as a jeweler ap-\nproaches a casket to unlock the hidden gems. Geikie\ncauses the bit of hard coal to unroll the juicy bud, the\nthick odorous leaves, the pungent boughs, until the bit of\ncarbon enlarges into the beauty of a tropic forest. That\nlittle book of Grant Allen's called \"How Plants Grow\" ex-\nhibits trees and shrubs as eating, drinking and marrying.\nWe see certain date groves in Palestine, and other date\ngroves in the desert a hundred miles away, and the pol-\nlen of the one carried upon the trade winds to the\nbranches of the other. We see the tree with its strange\nsystem of water-works, pumping the sap up through\npipes and mains; we see the chemical laboratory in the\nbranches mixing flavor for the orange in one bough, mix-\ning the juices of the pineapple in another; we behold the\ntree as a mother making each infant acorn ready against\nthe long winter, rolling it in swaths soft and warm as\nwool blankets, wrapping it around with garments imper-\nvious to the rain, and finally slipping the infant acorn in-\nto a sleeping bag, like those the Eskimos gave Dr. Kane.\nAt length we come to feel that the Greeks were not far\nwrong in thinking each tree had a dryad in it, animating\nit, protecting it against destruction, dying when the tree\nwithered. Some Faraday shows us that each drop of\n9.Used by permission.\n161\nwater is a sheath for electric forces sufficient to charge\n800,000 Leyden jars, or drive an engine from Liverpool\nto London. Some Sir William Thomson tells us how hy-\ndrogen gas will chew up a large iron spike as a child's\nmolars will chew off the end of a stick of candy. Thus\neach new book opens up some new and hitherto unex-\nplored realm of nature. Thus books fulfill for us the le-\ngend of the wondrous glass that showed its owner all\nthings distant and all things hidden. Through books our\nworld becomes as \"a bud from the bower of God's\nbeauty; the sun as a spark from the light of His wisdom;\nthe sky as a bubble on the sea of His Power.\" Therefore\nMrs. Browning's words, \"No child can be called father-\nless who has God and his mother; no youth can be called\nfriendless who has God and the companionship of good\nbooks.\"\nBooks also advantage us in that they exhibit the unity of\nprogress, the solidarity of the race, and the continuity of\nhistory. Authors lead us back along the pathway of law,\nof liberty or religion, and set us down in front of the\ngreat man in whose brain the principle had its rise. As\nthe discoverer leads us from the mouth of the Nile back\nto the headwaters of Nyanza, so books exhibit great\nideas and institutions, as they move forward, ever widen-\ning and deepening, like some Nile feeding many civiliza-\ntions. For all the reforms of to-day go back to some re-\nform of yesterday. Man's art goes back to Athens and\nThebes. Man's laws go back to Blackstone and Justinian.\nMan's reapers and plows go back to the savage scratch-\ning the ground with his forked stick, drawn by the wild\nbullock. The heroes of liberty march forward in a solid\ncolumn. Lincoln grasps the hand of Washington. Wash-\nington received his weapons at the hands of Hampden\nand Cromwell. The great Puritans lock hands with Luth-\ner and Savonarola.\nThe unbroken procession brings us at length to Him\nwhose Sermon on the Mount was the very charter of\nliberty. It puts us under a divine spell to perceive that we\nare all coworkers with the great men, and yet single\nthreads in the warp and woof of civilization. And when\n162\nbooks have related us to our own age, and related all the\nepochs to God, whose providence is the gulf stream of\nhistory, these teachers go on to stimulate us to new and\ngreater achievements. Alone, man is an unlighted\ncandle. The mind needs some book to kindle its faculties.\nBefore Byron began to write he used to give half an hour\nto reading some favorite passage. The thought of some\ngreat writer never failed to kindle Byron into a creative\nglow, even as a match lights the kindlings upon the\ngrate. In these burning, luminous moods Byron's mind\ndid its best work. The true book stimulates the mind as\nno wine can ever quicken the blood. It is reading that\nbrings us to our best, and rouses each faculty to its most\nvigorous life.\nWe recognize this as pure cream, and if it seems at first to\nhave its secondary source in the friendly milkman, let us not\nforget that the theme is \"The Uses of Books and Reading.\" Dr.\nHillis both sees and thinks.\nIt is fashionable just now to decry the value of reading. We\nread, we are told, to avoid the necessity of thinking for\nourselves. Books are for the mentally lazy.\nThough this is only a half-truth, the element of truth it con-\ntains is large enough to make us pause. Put yourself through a\ngood old Presbyterian soul-searching self-examination, and if\nreading-from-thought-laziness is one of your sins, confess it.\nNo one can shrive you of it\u2014but yourself. Do penance for it by\nusing your own brains, for it is a transgression that dwarfs the\ngrowth of thought and destroys mental freedom. At first the\npenance will be trying\u2014but at the last you will be glad in it.\nReading should entertain, give information, or stimulate\nthought. Here, however, we are chiefly concerned with inform-\nation, and stimulation of thought.\nWhat shall I read for information?\nThe ample page of knowledge, as Grey tells us, is \"rich with\nthe spoils of time,\" and these are ours for the price of a theatre\nticket. You may command Socrates and Marcus Aurelius to sit\nbeside you and discourse of their choicest, hear Lincoln at\nGettysburg and Pericles at Athens, storm the Bastile with\nHugo, and wander through Paradise with Dante. You may\n163\nexplore darkest Africa with Stanley, penetrate the human heart\nwith Shakespeare, chat with Carlyle about heroes, and delve\nwith the Apostle Paul into the mysteries of faith. The general\nknowledge and the inspiring ideas that men have collected\nthrough ages of toil and experiment are yours for the asking.\nThe Sage of Chelsea was right: \"The true university of these\ndays is a collection of books.\"\nTo master a worth-while book is to master much else be-\nsides; few of us, however, make perfect conquest of a volume\nwithout first owning it physically. To read a borrowed book\nmay be a joy, but to assign your own book a place of its own on\nyour own shelves\u2014be they few or many\u2014to love the book and\nfeel of its worn cover, to thumb it over slowly, page by page, to\npencil its margins in agreement or in protest, to smile or thrill\nwith its remembered pungencies\u2014no mere book borrower\ncould ever sense all that delight.\nThe reader who possesses books in this double sense finds\nalso that his books possess him, and the volumes which most\nfirmly grip his life are likely to be those it has cost him some\nsacrifice to own. These lightly-come-by titles, which Mr. Fat-\npurse selects, perhaps by proxy, can scarcely play the guide,\nphilosopher and friend in crucial moments as do the\nbooks\u2014long coveted, joyously attained\u2014that are welcomed in-\nto the lives, and not merely the libraries, of us others who are\nat once poorer and richer.\nSo it is scarcely too much to say that of all the many ways in\nwhich an owned\u2014a mastered\u2014book is like to a human friend,\nthe truest ways are these: A friend is worth making sacrifices\nfor, both to gain and to keep; and our loves go out most dearly\nto those into whose inmost lives we have sincerely entered.\nWhen you have not the advantage of the test of time by\nwhich to judge books, investigate as thoroughly as possible the\nauthority of the books you read. Much that is printed and\npasses current is counterfeit. \"I read it in a book\" is to many a\nsufficient warranty of truth, but not to the thinker. \"What\nbook?\" asks the careful mind. \"Who wrote it? What does he\nknow about the subject and what right has he to speak on it?\nWho recognizes him as authority? With what other recognized\nauthorities does he agree or disagree?\" Being caught trying to\n164\npass counterfeit money, even unintentionally, is an unpleasant\nsituation. Beware lest you circulate spurious coin.\nAbove all, seek reading that makes you use your own brains.\nSuch reading must be alive with fresh points of view, packed\nwith special knowledge, and deal with subjects of vital interest.\nDo not confine your reading to what you already know you will\nagree with. Opposition wakes one up. The other road may be\nthe better, but you will never know it unless you \"give it the\nonce over.\" Do not do all your thinking and investigating in\nfront of given \"Q.E.D.'s;\" merely assembling reasons to fill in\nbetween your theorem and what you want to prove will get you\nnowhere. Approach each subject with an open mind and\u2014once\nthoroughly and hon-\nsure that you have thought\nestly\u2014have the courage to abide by the decision of your own\nthought. But don't brag about it afterward.\nit out\nNo book on public speaking will enable you to discourse on\nthe tariff if you know nothing about the tariff. Knowing more\nabout it than the other man will be your only hope for making\nthe other man listen to you.\nTake a group of men discussing a governmental policy of\nwhich some one says: \"It is socialistic.\" That will commend the\npolicy to Mr. A., who believes in socialism, but condemn it to\nMr. B., who does not. It may be that neither had considered the\npolicy beyond noticing that its surface-color was socialistic.\nThe chances are, furthermore, that neither Mr. A. nor Mr. B.\nhas a definite idea of what socialism really is, for as Robert\nLouis Stevenson says, \"Man lives not by bread alone but chiefly\nby catch words.\" If you are of this group of men, and have ob-\nserved this proposed government policy, and investigated it,\nand thought about it, what you have to say cannot fail to com-\nmand their respect and approval, for you will have shown them\nthat you possess a grasp of your subject and\u2014to adopt an ex-\nceedingly expressive bit of slang\u2014then some.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

You must hear with the speaker's ear, see with the\nspeaker's eye, and choose books and companions and sights\nand sounds with the speaker's purpose in view. At the same\ntime, be ready to receive unplanned-for knowledge. One of the\nfascinating elements in your life as a public speaker will be the\nconscious growth in power that casual daily experiences bring.\nIf your eyes are alert you will be constantly discovering facts,\nillustrations, and ideas without having set out in search of\nthem. These all may be turned to account on the platform; even\nthe leaden events of hum-drum daily life may be melted into\nbullets for future battles.\nConservation of Time in Preparation\nBut, you say, I have so little time for preparation\u2014my mind\nmust be absorbed by other matters. Daniel Webster never let\nan opportunity pass to gather material for his speeches. When\nhe was a boy working in a sawmill he read out of a book in one\nhand and busied himself at some mechanical task with the oth-\ner. In youth Patrick Henry roamed the fields and woods in\nsolitude for days at a time unconsciously gathering material\nand impressions for his later service as a speaker. Dr. Russell\nH. Conwell, the man who, the late Charles A. Dana said, had\naddressed more hearers than any living man, used to memorize\nlong passages from Milton while tending the boiling syrup-pans\nin the silent New England woods at night. The modern employ-\ner would discharge a Webster of today for inattention to duty,\nand doubtless he would be justified, and Patrick Henry seemed\nonly an idle chap even in those easy-going days; but the truth\nremains: those who take in power and have the purpose to use\nit efficiently will some day win to the place in which that\nstored-up power will revolve great wheels of influence.\nNapoleon said that quarter hours decide the destinies of na-\ntions. How many quarter hours do we let drift by aimlessly!\nRobert Louis Stevenson conserved all his time; every experi-\nence became capital for his work\u2014for capital may be defined\nas \"the results of labor stored up to assist future production.\"\nHe continually tried to put into suitable language the scenes\nand actions that were in evidence about him. Emerson says:\n\"Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself whilst we are\npreparing to live.\"\n168\nWhy wait for a more convenient season for this broad, gener-\nal preparation? The fifteen minutes that we spend on the car\ncould be profitably turned into speech-capital.\nProcure a cheap edition of modern speeches, and by cutting\nout a few pages each day, and reading them during the idle\nminute here and there, note how soon you can make yourself\nfamiliar with the world's best speeches. If you do not wish to\nmutilate your book, take it with you\u2014most of the epoch-making\nbooks are now printed in small volumes. The daily waste of nat-\nural gas in the Oklahoma fields is equal to ten thousand tons of\ncoal. Only about three per cent of the power of the coal that\nenters the furnace ever diffuses itself from your electric bulb\nas light\u2014the other ninety-seven per cent is wasted. Yet these\nwastes are no larger, nor more to be lamented than the tre-\nmendous waste of time which, if conserved would increase the\nspeaker's powers to their nth degree. Scientists are making\nthree ears of corn grow where one grew before; efficiency en-\ngineers are eliminating useless motions and products from our\nfactories: catch the spirit of the age and apply efficiency to the\nuse of the most valuable asset you possess\u2014time. What do you\ndo mentally with the time you spend in dressing or in shaving?\nTake some subject and concentrate your energies on it for a\nweek by utilizing just the spare moments that would otherwise\nbe wasted. You will be amazed at the result. One passage a day\nfrom the Book of Books, one golden ingot from some master\nmind, one fully-possessed thought of your own might thus be\nadded to the treasury of your life. Do not waste your time in\nways that profit you nothing. Fill \"the unforgiving minute\" with\n\"sixty seconds' worth of distance run\" and on the platform you\nwill be immeasurably the gainer.\nLet no word of this, however, seem to decry the value of re-\ncreation. Nothing is more vital to a worker than rest\u2014yet noth-\ning is so vitiating to the shirker. Be sure that your recreation\nre-creates. A pause in the midst of labors gathers strength for\nnew effort. The mistake is to pause too long, or to fill your\npauses with ideas that make life flabby.\nChoosing a Subject\nSubject and materials tremendously influence each other.\n169\n\"This arises from the fact that there are two distinct ways in\nwhich a subject may be chosen: by arbitrary choice, or by de-\nvelopment from thought and reading.\n\"Arbitrary choice \u2026 of one subject from among a number in-\nvolves so many important considerations that no speaker ever\nfails to appreciate the tone of satisfaction in him who tri-\numphantly announces: 'I have a subject!'\n\"'Do give me a subject!' How often the weary school teacher\nhears that cry. Then a list of themes is suggested, gone over,\nin most instances, rejected, because the\nconsidered, and,\nteacher can know but imperfectly what is in the pupil's mind.\nTo suggest a subject in this way is like trying to discover the\nstreet on which a lost child lives, by naming over a number of\nstreets until one strikes the little one's ear as sounding\nfamiliar.\n\"Choice by development is a very different process. It does\nnot ask, What shall I say? It turns the mind in upon itself and\nasks, What do I think? Thus, the subject may be said to choose\nitself, for in the process of thought or of reading one theme\nrises into prominence and becomes a living germ, soon to grow\ninto the discourse. He who has not learned to reflect is not\nreally acquainted with his own thoughts; hence, his thoughts\nare not productive. Habits of reading and reflection will supply\nthe speaker's mind with an abundance of subjects of which he\nalready knows something from the very reading and reflection\nwhich gave birth to his theme. This is not a paradox, but sober\ntruth.\n\"It must be already apparent that the choice of a subject by\ndevelopment savors more of collection than of conscious selec-\ntion. The subject 'pops into the mind.' \u2026 In the intellect of the\ntrained thinker it concentrates\u2014by a process which we have\nseen to be induction\u2014the facts and truths of which he has been\nreading and thinking. This is most often a gradual process. The\nscattered ideas may be but vaguely connected at first, but\nmore and more they concentrate and take on a single form un-\ntil at length one strong idea seems to grasp the soul with irres-\nistible force, and to cry aloud, 'Arise, I am your theme! Hence-\nforth, until you transmute me by the alchemy of your inward\nfire into vital speech, you shall know no rest!' Happy, then, is\nthat speaker, for he has found a subject that grips him.\n170\n\"Of course, experienced speakers use both methods of selec-\ntion. Even a reading and reflective man is sometimes com-\npelled to hunt for a theme from Dan to Beersheba, and then\nthe task of gathering materials becomes a serious one. But\neven in such a case there is a sense in which the selection\ncomes by development, because no careful speaker settles\nupon a theme which does not represent at least some matured\nthought.\"10\nDeciding on the Subject Matter\nEven when your theme has been chosen for you by someone\nelse, there remains to you a considerable field for choice of\nsubject matter. The same considerations, in fact, that would\ngovern you in choosing a theme must guide in the selection of\nthe material. Ask yourself\u2014or someone else\u2014such questions as\nthese:\nWhat is the precise nature of the occasion? How large an\naudience may be expected? From what walks of life do they\ncome? What is their probable attitude toward the theme? Who\nelse will speak? Do I speak first, last, or where, on the pro-\ngram? What are the other speakers going to talk about? What\nis the nature of the auditorium? Is there a desk? Could the sub-\nject be more effectively handled if somewhat modified? Pre-\ncisely how much time am I to fill?\nIt is evident that many speech-misfits of subject, speaker, oc-\ncasion and place are due to failure to ask just such pertinent\nquestions.What should be said, by whom, and in what circum-\nstances, constitute ninety per cent of efficiency in public ad-\ndress. No matter who asks you, refuse to be a square peg in a\nround hole.\nQuestions of Proportion\nProportion in a speech is attained by a nice adjustment of\ntime. How fully you may treat your subject it is not always for\nyou to say. Let ten minutes mean neither nine nor elev-\nen\u2014though better nine than eleven, at all events. You wouldn't\nsteal a man's watch; no more should you steal the time of the\nsucceeding speaker, or that of the audience. There is no need\nto overstep time-limits if you make your preparation adequate\nand divide your subject so as to give each thought its due\n10.How to Attract and Hold an Audience, J. Berg Esenwein.\n171\nproportion of attention\u2014and no more. Blessed is the man that\nmaketh short speeches, for he shall be invited to speak again.\nAnother matter of prime importance is, what part of your ad-\ndress demands the most emphasis. This once decided, you will\nknow where to place that pivotal section so as to give it the\ngreatest strategic value, and what degree of preparation must\nbe given to that central thought so that the vital part may not\nbe submerged by non-essentials. Many a speaker has\nawakened to find that he has burnt up eight minutes of a ten-\nminute speech in merely getting up steam. That is like spend-\ning eighty percent of your building-money on the vestibule of\nthe house.\nThe same sense of proportion must tell you to stop precisely\nwhen you are through\u2014and it is to be hoped that you will dis-\ncover the arrival of that period before your audience does.\nTapping Original Sources\nThe surest way to give life to speech-material is to gather\nyour facts at first hand. Your words come with the weight of\nauthority when you can say, \"I have examined the employment\nrolls of every mill in this district and find that thirty-two per\ncent of the children employed are under the legal age.\" No\ncitation of authorities can equal that. You must adopt the meth-\nods of the reporter and find out the facts underlying your argu-\nment or appeal. To do so may prove laborious, but it should not\nbe irksome, for the great world of fact teems with interest, and\nover and above all is the sense of power that will come to you\nfrom original investigation. To see and feel the facts you are\ndiscussing will react upon you much more powerfully than if\nyou were to secure the facts at second hand.\nLive an active life among people who are doing worth-while\nthings, keep eyes and ears and mind and heart open to absorb\ntruth, and then tell of the things you know, as if you know\nthem. The world will listen, for the world loves nothing so\nmuch as real life.\nHow to Use a Library\nUnsuspected treasures lie in the smallest library. Even when\nthe owner has read every last page of his books it is only in\nrare instances that he has full indexes to all of them, either in\nhis mind or on paper, so as to make available the vast number\n172\nof varied subjects touched upon or treated in volumes whose\ntitles would never suggest such topics.\nFor this reason it is a good thing to take an odd hour now\nand then to browse. Take down one volume after another and\nlook over its table of contents and its index. (It is a reproach to\nany author of a serious book not to have provided a full index,\nwith cross references.) Then glance over the pages, making\nnotes, mental or physical, of material that looks interesting and\nusable. Most libraries contain volumes that the owner is \"going\nto read some day.\" A familiarity with even the contents of such\nbooks on your own shelves will enable you to refer to them\nwhen you want help. Writings read long ago should be treated\nin the same way\u2014in every chapter some surprise lurks to de-\nlight you.\nIn looking up a subject do not be discouraged if you do not\nfind it indexed or outlined in the table of contents\u2014you are\npretty sure to discover some material under a related title.\nSuppose you set to work somewhat in this way to gather ref-\nerences on \"Thinking:\" First you look over your book titles, and\nthere is Schaeffer's \"Thinking and Learning to Think.\" Near it\nis Kramer's \"Talks to Students on the Art of Study\"\u2014that seems\nlikely to provide some material, and it does. Naturally you\nthink next of your book on psychology, and there is help there.\nIf you have a volume on the human intellect you will have\nalready turned to it. Suddenly you remember your encyclope-\ndia and your dictionary of quotations\u2014and now material fairly\nrains upon you; the problem is what not to use. In the encyclo-\npedia you turn to every reference that includes or touches or\neven suggests \"thinking;\" and in the dictionary of quotations\nyou do the same. The latter volume you find peculiarly helpful\nbecause it suggests several volumes to you that are on your\nown shelves\u2014you never would have thought to look in them for\nreferences on this subject. Even fiction will supply help, but es-\npecially books of essays and biography. Be aware of your own\nresources.\nTo make a general index to your library does away with the\nnecessity for indexing individual volumes that are not already\nindexed.\nTo begin with, keep a note-book by you; or small cards and\npaper cuttings in your pocket and on your desk will serve as\n173\nwell. The same note-book that records the impressions of your\nown experiences and thoughts will be enriched by the ideas of\nothers.\nTo be sure, this note-book habit means labor, but remember\nthat more speeches have been spoiled by half-hearted prepara-\ntion than by lack of talent. Laziness is an own-brother to Over-\nconfidence, and both are your inveterate enemies, though they\npretend to be soothing friends.\nConserve your material by indexing every good idea on\ncards, thus:\nSocialism\nProgress of S., Env. 16\nS. a fallacy, 96/210\nGeneral article on S., Howells', Dec. 1913\n\"Socialism and the Franchise,\" Forbes\n\"Socialism in Ancient Life,\" Original Ms.,\nEnv. 102\nOn the card illustrated above, clippings are indexed by giving\nthe number of the envelope in which they are filed. The envel-\nopes may be of any size desired and kept in any convenient re-\nceptacle. On the foregoing example, \"Progress of S., Envelope\n16,\" will represent a clipping, filed in Envelope 16, which is, of\ncourse, numbered arbitrarily.\nThe fractions refer to books in your library\u2014the numerator\nbeing the book-number, the denominator referring to the page.\nThus, \"S. a fallacy, 96/210,\" refers to page 210 of volume 96 in\nyour library. By some arbitrary sign\u2014say red ink\u2014you may\neven index a reference in a public library book.\nIf you preserve your magazines, important articles may be in-\ndexed by month and year. An entire volume on a subject may\nbe indicated like the imaginary book by \"Forbes.\" If you clip\nthe articles, it is better to index them according to the envel-\nope system.\nYour own writings and notes may be filed in envelopes with\nthe clippings or in a separate series.\nAnother good indexing system combines the library index\nwith the \"scrap,\" or clipping, system by making the outside of\nthe envelope serve the same purpose as the card for the index-\ning of books, magazines, clippings and manuscripts, the latter\n174\ntwo classes of material being enclosed in the envelopes that in-\ndex them, and all filed alphabetically.\nWhen your cards accumulate so as to make ready reference\ndifficult under a single alphabet, you may subdivide each letter\nby subordinate guide cards marked by the vowels, A, E, I, O, U.\nThus, \"Antiquities\" would be filed under i in A, because A be-\ngins the word, and the second letter, n, comes after the vow-\nel i in the alphabet, but before o. In the same manner, \"Beech-\ner\" would be filed under e in B; and \"Hydrogen\" would come\nunder u in H.\nOutlining the Address\nNo one can advise you how to prepare the notes for an ad-\ndress. Some speakers get the best results while walking out\nand ruminating, jotting down notes as they pause in their walk.\nOthers never put pen to paper until the whole speech has been\nthought out. The great majority, however, will take notes, clas-\nsify their notes, write a hasty first draft, and then revise the\nspeech. Try each of these methods and choose the one that is\nbest\u2014for you. Do not allow any man to force you to work\nin his way; but do not neglect to consider his way, for it may be\nbetter than your own.\nFor those who make notes and with their aid write out the\nspeech, these suggestions may prove helpful:\nAfter having read and thought enough, classify your notes by\nsetting down the big, central thoughts of your material on sep-\narate cards or slips of paper. These will stand in the same rela-\ntion to your subject as chapters do to a book.\nThen arrange these main ideas or heads in such an order\nthat they will lead effectively to the result you have in mind, so\nthat the speech may rise in argument, in interest, in power, by\npiling one fact or appeal upon another until the climax\u2014the\nhighest point of influence on your audience\u2014has been reached.\nNext group all your ideas, facts, anecdotes, and illustrations\nunder the foregoing main heads, each where it naturally\nbelongs.\nYou now have a skeleton or outline of your address that in its\npolished form might serve either as the brief, or manuscript\nnotes, for the speech or as the guide-outline which you will ex-\npand into the written address, if written it is to be.\n175\nImagine each of the main ideas in the brief on page 213 as\nbeing separate; then picture your mind as sorting them out and\nplacing them in order; finally, conceive of how you would fill in\nthe facts and examples under each head, giving special prom-\ninence to those you wish to emphasize and subduing those of\nless moment. In the end, you have the outline complete. The\nsimplest form of outline\u2014not very suitable for use on the plat-\nform, however\u2014is the following:\nWHY PROSPERITY IS COMING\nWhat prosperity means.\u2014The real tests of prosperity.\u2014Its\nbasis in the soil.\u2014American agricultural progress.\u2014New in-\nterest\nin farming.\u2014Enormous value of our agricultural\nproducts.\u2014Reciprocal effect on trade.\u2014Foreign countries af-\nfected.\u2014Effects of our new internal economy\u2014the regulation of\nbanking and \"big business\"\u2014on prosperity.\u2014Effects of our re-\nvised attitude toward foreign markets, including our merchant\nmarine.\u2014Summary.\nObviously, this very simple outline is capable of considerable\nexpansion under each head by the addition of facts, arguments,\ninferences and examples.\nHere is an outline arranged with more regard for argument:\nFOREIGN IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE RESTRICTED11\nI. Fact As Cause: Many immigrants are practically pau-\npers. (Proofs involving statistics or statements of\nauthorities.)\nII. Fact As Effect: They sooner or later fill our alms-\nhouses and become public charges. (Proofs involving\nstatistics or statements of authorities.)\nIII.

Then, whatever you do, write it\nat white heat, with not too much thought of anything but the\nstrong, appealing expression of your ideas.\nThe final stage is the paring down, the re-vision\u2014the seeing\nagain, as the word implies\u2014when all the parts of the speech\nmust be impartially scrutinized for clearness, precision, force,\neffectiveness, suitability, proportion, logical climax; and in all\nthis you mustimagine yourself to be before your audience, for a\nspeech is not an essay and what will convince and arouse in\nthe one will not prevail in the other.\nThe Title\nOften last of all will come that which in a sense is first of\nall\u2014the title, the name by which the speech is known. Some-\ntimes it will be the simple theme of the address, as \"The New\nAmericanism,\" by Henry Watterson; or it may be a bit of sym-\nbolism typifying the spirit of the address, as \"Acres of Dia-\nmonds,\" by Russell H. Conwell; or it may be a fine phrase taken\nfrom the body of the address, as \"Pass Prosperity Around,\" by\nin all, from whatever motive it be\nAlbert J. Beveridge. All\nchosen, let the title be fresh, short, suited to the subject, and\nlikely to excite interest.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Define (a) introduction; (b) climax; (c) peroration.\n2. If a thirty-minute speech would require three hours for\nspecific preparation, would you expect to be able to do equal\njustice to a speech one-third as long in one-third the time for\npreparation? Give reasons.\n3. Relate briefly any personal experience you may have had\nin conserving time for reading and thought.\n4. In the manner of a reporter or investigator, go out and get\nfirst-hand information on some subject of interest to the public.\n178\nArrange the results of your research in the form of an outline,\nor brief.\n5. From a private or a public library gather enough authorit-\native material on one of the following questions to build an out-\nline for a twenty-minute address. Take one definite side of the\nquestion, (a) \"The Housing of the Poor;\" (b) \"The Commission\nForm of Government for Cities as a Remedy for Political Graft;\"\n(c) \"The Test of Woman's Suffrage in the West;\" (d) \"Present\nTrends of Public Taste in Reading;\" (e) \"Municipal Art;\" (f) \"Is\nthe Theatre Becoming more Elevated in Tone?\" (g) \"The Effects\nof the Magazine on Literature;\" (h) \"Does Modern Life Destroy\nIdeals?\" (i) \"Is Competition 'the Life of Trade?'\" (j) \"Baseball is\ntoo Absorbing to be a Wholesome National Game;\" (k) \"Sum-\nmer Baseball and Amateur Standing;\" (l) \"Does College Train-\ning Unfit a Woman for Domestic Life?\" (m) \"Does Woman's\nCompetition with Man in Business Dull the Spirit of Chivalry?\"\n(n) \"Are Elective Studies Suited to High School Courses?\" (o)\n\"Does the Modern College Prepare Men for Preeminent Lead-\nership?\" (p) \"The Y.M.C.A. in Its Relation to the Labor Prob-\nlem;\" (q) \"Public Speaking as Training in Citizenship.\"\n6. Construct the outline, examining it carefully for interest,\nconvincing character, proportion, and climax of arrangement.\nNOTE:\u2014This exercise should be repeated until the student\nshows facility in synthetic arrangement.\n7. Deliver the address, if possible before an audience.\n8. Make a three-hundred word report on the results, as best\nyou are able to estimate them.\n9. Tell something of the benefits of using a periodical (or cu-\nmulative) index.\n10. Give a number of quotations, suitable for a speaker's use,\nthat you have memorized in off moments.\n11. In the manner of the outline on page 213, analyze the ad-\ndress on pages 78-79, \"The History of Liberty.\"\n12. Give an outline analysis, from notes or memory, of an ad-\ndress or sermon to which you have listened for this purpose.\n13. Criticise the address from a structural point of view.\n14. Invent titles for any five of the themes in Exercise 5.\n15. Criticise the titles of any five chapters of this book, sug-\ngesting better ones.\n179\n16. Criticise the title of any lecture or address of which you\nknow.\n180\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 18\nSUBJECT AND PREPARATION\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Speak not at all, in any wise, till you have somewhat to\nspeak; care not for the reward of your speaking, but\nsimply and with undivided mind for the truth of your\nspeaking.\n\u2014Thomas Carlyle, Essay on Biography.\nA complete discussion of the rhetorical structure of public\nspeeches requires a fuller treatise than can be undertaken in a\nwork of this nature, yet in this chapter, and in the succeeding\nones\nand\n\"Pleading,\" the underlying principles are given and explained\nas fully as need be for a working knowledge, and adequate\nbook references are given for those who would perfect them-\nselves in rhetorical art.\n\"Description,\"\n\"Argument,\"\n\"Narration,\"\non\nThe Nature of Exposition\nIn the word \"expose\"\u2014to lay bare, to uncover, to show the\ntrue inwardness of\u2014we see the foundation-idea of \"Exposition.\"\nIt is the clear and precise setting forth of what the subject\nreally is\u2014it is explanation.\nExposition does not draw a picture, for that would be de-\nscription. To tell in exact terms what the automobile is, to\nname its characteristic parts and explain their workings, would\nbe exposition; so would an explanation of the nature of \"fear.\"\nBut to create a mental image of a particular automobile, with\nits glistening body, graceful lines, and great speed, would be\ndescription; and so would a picturing of fear acting on the emo-\ntions of a child at night. Exposition and description often inter-\nmingle and overlap, but fundamentally they are distinct. Their\ndifferences will be touched upon again in the chapter on\n\"Description.\"\n181\nExposition furthermore does not include an account of how\nevents happened\u2014that is narration. When Peary lectured on\nhis polar discoveries he explained the instruments used for de-\ntermining latitude and longitude\u2014that was exposition. In pic-\nturing his equipment he used description. In telling of his ad-\nventures day by day he employed narration. In supporting\nsome of his contentions he used argument. Yet he mingled all\nthese forms throughout the lecture.\nNeither does exposition deal with reasons and infer-\nences\u2014that is the field of argument. A series of connected\nstatements intended to convince a prospective buyer that one\nautomobile is better than another, or proofs that the appeal to\nfear is a wrong method of discipline, would not be exposition.\nThe plain facts as set forth in expository speaking or writing\nare nearly always the basis of argument, yet the processes are\nnot one. True, the statement of a single significant fact without\nthe addition of one other word may be convincing, but a\nmoment's thought will show that the inference, which com-\npletes a chain of reasoning, is made in the mind of the hearer\nand presupposes other facts held in consideration.12\nIn like manner, it is obvious that the field of persuasion is not\nopen to exposition, for exposition is entirely an intellectual pro-\ncess, with no emotional element.\nThe Importance of Exposition\nThe importance of exposition in public speech is precisely the\nimportance of setting forth a matter so plainly that it cannot be\nmisunderstood.\n\"To master the process of exposition is to become a clear\nthinker. 'I know, when you do not ask me,'13 replied a\ngentleman upon being requested to define a highly com-\nplex idea. Now some large concepts defy explicit defini-\ntion; but no mind should take refuge behind such excep-\ntions, for where definition fails, other forms succeed. So-\nmetimes we feel confident that we have perfect mastery\nof an idea, but when the time comes to express it, the\nclearness becomes a haze. Exposition, then, is the test of\nclear understanding. To speak effectively you must be\n12.Argumentation will be outlined fully in subsequent chapter.\n13.The Working Principles of Rhetoric, J.F. Genung.\n182\nable to see your subject clearly and comprehensively,\nand to make your audience see it as you do.\"14\nThere are pitfalls on both sides of this path. To explain too\nlittle will leave your audience in doubt as to what you mean. It\nis useless to argue a question if it is not perfectly clear just\nwhat is meant by the question. Have you never come to a blind\nlane in conversation by finding that you were talking of one as-\npect of a matter while your friend was thinking of another? If\ntwo do not agree in their definitions of a Musician, it is useless\nto dispute over a certain man's right to claim the title.\nOn the other side of the path lies the abyss of tediously ex-\nplaining too much. That offends because it impresses the hear-\ners that you either do not respect their intelligence or are try-\ning to blow a breeze into a tornado. Carefully estimate the\nprobable knowledge of your audience, both in general and of\nthe particular point you are explaining. In trying to simplify, it\nis fatal to \"sillify.\" To explain more than is needed for the pur-\nis to waste energy all\nposes of your argument or appeal\naround. In your efforts to be explicit do not press exposition to\nthe extent of dulness\u2014the confines are not far distant and you\nmay arrive before you know it.\nSome Purposes of Exposition\nFrom what has been said it ought to be clear that, primarily,\nexposition weaves a cord of understanding between you and\nyour audience. It lays, furthermore, a foundation of fact on\nwhich to build later statements, arguments, and appeals. In\nscientific and purely \"information\" speeches exposition may ex-\nist by itself and for itself, as in a lecture on biology, or on psy-\nchology; but in the vast majority of cases it is used to accom-\npany and prepare the way for the other forms of discourse.\nClearness, precision, accuracy, unity,\ntruth, and neces-\nsity\u2014these must be the constant standards by which you test\nthe efficiency of your expositions, and, indeed, that of every ex-\nplanatory statement. This dictum should be written on your\nbrain in letters most plain. And let this apply not alone to\nthe purposes of exposition but in equal measure to your use of\nthe\nMethods of Exposition\n14.How to Attract and Hold an Audience, J. Berg Esenwein.\n183\nThe various ways along which a speaker may proceed in ex-\nposition are likely to touch each other now and then, and even\nwhen they do not meet and actually overlap they run so nearly\nparallel that the roads are sometimes distinct rather in theory\nthan in any more practical respect.\nDefinition, the primary expository method, is a statement of\nprecise limits.15 Obviously, here the greatest care must be ex-\nercised that the terms of definition should not themselves de-\nmand too much definition; that the language should be concise\nand clear; and that the definition should neither exclude nor in-\nclude too much. The following is a simple example:\nTo expound is to set forth the nature, the significance,\nthe characteristics, and the bearing of an idea or a group\nof ideas.\n\u2014Arlo Bates, Talks on Writing English.\nContrast and Antithesis are often used effectively to ampli-\nfy definition, as in this sentence, which immediately follows the\nabove-cited definition:\nExposition therefore differs from Description in that it deals\ndirectly with the meaning or intent of its subject instead of\nwith its appearance.\nThis antithesis forms an expansion of the definition, and as\nsuch it might have been still further extended. In fact, this is a\nfrequent practise in public speech, where the minds of the\nhearers often ask for reiteration and expanded statement to\nhelp them grasp a subject in its several aspects. This is the\nvery heart of exposition\u2014to amplify and clarify all the terms by\nwhich a matter is defined.\nExample is another method of amplifying a definition or of\nexpounding an idea more fully. The following sentences imme-\ndiately succeed Mr. Bates's definition and contrast just quoted:\nA good deal which we are accustomed inexactly to call\ndescription is really exposition. Suppose that your small\nboy wishes to know how an engine works, and should\nsay: \"Please describe the steam-engine to me.\" If you in-\nsist on taking his words literally\u2014and are willing to run\n15.On the various types of definition see any college manual of Rhetoric.\n184\nthe risk of his indignation at being wilfully misunder-\nstood\u2014you will to the best of your ability picture to him\nthis familiarly wonderful machine. If you explain it to\nhim, you are not describing but expounding it.\nThe chief value of example is that it makes clear the un-\nknown by referring the mind to the known. Readiness of mind\nto make illuminating, apt comparisons for the sake of clearness\nis one of the speaker's chief resources on the platform\u2014it is\nthe greatest of all teaching gifts. It is a gift, moreover, that re-\nsponds to cultivation. Read the three extracts from Arlo Bates\nas their author delivered them, as one passage, and see how\nthey melt into one, each part supplementing the other most\nhelpfully.\nAnalogy, which calls attention to similar relationships in ob-\njects not otherwise similar, is one of the most useful methods\nof exposition. The following striking specimen is\nfrom\nBeecher's Liverpool speech:\nA savage is a man of one story, and that one story a cel-\nlar. When a man begins to be civilized he raises another\nstory. When you christianize and civilize the man, you\nput story upon story, for you develop faculty after fac-\nulty; and you have to supply every story with your\nproductions.\nDiscarding is a less common form of platform explanation. It\nconsists in clearing away associated ideas so that the attention\nmay be centered on the main thought to be discussed. Really, it\nis a negative factor in exposition though a most important one,\nfor it is fundamental to the consideration of an intricately re-\nlated matter that subordinate and side questions should be set\naside in order to bring out the main issue. Here is an example\nof the method:\nI cannot allow myself to be led aside from the only issue\nbefore this jury. It is not pertinent to consider that this\nprisoner is the husband of a heartbroken woman and\nthat his babes will go through the world under the shad-\now of the law's extremest penalty worked upon their\nfather. We must forget the venerable father and the\n185\nmother whom Heaven in pity took before she learned of\nher son's disgrace. What have these matters of heart,\nwhat have the blenched faces of his friends, what have\nthe prisoner's long and honorable career to say before\nthis bar when you are sworn to weigh only the direct\nevidence before you? The one and only question for you\nto decide on the evidence is whether this man did with\nrevengeful intent commit the murder that every impar-\ntial witness has solemnly laid at his door.\nClassification assigns a subject to its class. By an allowable\nextension of the definition it may be said to assign it also to its\nin public\norder, genus, and species. Classification is useful\nspeech in narrowing the issue to a desired phase. It is equally\nvaluable for showing a thing in its relation to other things, or\nin correlation. Classification is closely akin to Definition and\nDivision.\nThis question of the liquor traffic, sirs, takes its place be-\nside the grave moral issues of all times. Whatever be its\neconomic significance\u2014and who is there to question\nit\u2014whatever vital bearing it has upon our political sys-\ntem\u2014and is there one who will deny it?\u2014the question of\nthe licensed saloon must quickly be settled as the world\nin its advancement has settled the questions of constitu-\ntional government for the masses, of the opium traffic, of\nthe serf, and of the slave\u2014not as matters of economic\nand political expediency but as questions of right and\nwrong.\nAnalysis separates a subject into its essential parts. This it\nmay do by various principles; for example, analysis may follow\nthe order of time (geologic eras), order of place (geographic\nfacts), logical order (a sermon outline), order of increasing in-\nterest, or procession to a climax (a lecture on 20th century po-\nets); and so on. A classic example of analytical exposition is the\nfollowing:\nIn philosophy the contemplations of man do either penet-\nrate unto God, or are circumferred to nature, or are re-\nflected or reverted upon himself. Out of which several\n186\ninquiries there do arise three knowledges: divine philo-\nsophy, natural philosophy, and human philosophy or hu-\nmanity. For all things are marked and stamped with this\ntriple character, of the power of God, the difference of\nnature, and the use of man.\n\u2014Lord Bacon, The Advancement of Learning.16\nDivision differs only from analysis in that analysis follows\nthe inherent divisions of a subject, as illustrated in the forego-\ning passage, while division arbitrarily separates the subject for\nconvenience of treatment, as in the following none-too-logical\nexample:\nFor civil history, it is of three kinds; not unfitly to be\ncompared with the three kinds of pictures or images. For\nof pictures or images, we see some are unfinished, some\nare perfect, and some are defaced. So of histories we\nmay find three kinds, memorials, perfect histories, and\nantiquities; for memorials are history unfinished, or the\nfirst or rough drafts of history; and antiquities are his-\ntory defaced, or some remnants of history which have\ncasually escaped the shipwreck of time.\n\u2014Lord Bacon, The Advancement of Learning.17\nGeneralization states a broad principle, or a general truth,\nderived from examination of a considerable number of indi-\nvidual facts. This synthetic exposition is not the same as argu-\nmentative generalization, which supports a general contention\nby citing instances in proof. Observe how Holmes begins with\none fact, and by adding another and another reaches a com-\nplete whole. This is one of the most effective devices in the\npublic speaker's repertory.\nTake a hollow cylinder, the bottom closed while the top\nremains open, and pour in water to the height of a few\ninches. Next cover the water with a flat plate or piston,\nwhich fits the interior of the cylinder perfectly; then ap-\nply heat to the water, and we shall witness the following\n16.Quoted in The Working Principles of Rhetoric, J.F. Genung.\n17.Quoted in The Working Principles of Rhetoric, J.F. Genung.\n187\nphenomena. After the lapse of some minutes the water\nwill begin to boil, and the steam accumulating at the up-\nper surface will make room for itself by raising the pis-\nton slightly. As the boiling continues, more and more\nsteam will be formed, and raise the piston higher and\nhigher, till all the water is boiled away, and nothing but\nsteam is left in the cylinder. Now this machine, consist-\ning of cylinder, piston, water, and fire, is the steam-en-\ngine in its most elementary form. For a steam-engine\nmay be defined as an apparatus for doing work by means\nof heat applied to water; and since raising such a weight\nas the piston is a form of doing work, this apparatus,\nclumsy and inconvenient though it may be, answers the\ndefinition precisely.18\nReference to Experience is one of the most vital principles\nin exposition\u2014as in every other form of discourse.\n\"Reference to experience, as here used, means reference to\nthe known. The known is that which the listener has seen,\nheard, read, felt, believed or done, and which still exists in his\nconsciousness\u2014his stock of knowledge. It embraces all those\nthoughts, feelings and happenings which are to him real. Re-\nference to Experience, then, means coming into the listener's\nlife.19\nThe vast results obtained by science are won by no mys-\ntical faculties, by no mental processes, other than those\nwhich are practised by every one of us in the humblest\nand meanest affairs of life. A detective policeman discov-\ners a burglar from the marks made by his shoe, by a\nmental process identical with that by which Cuvier re-\nstored the extinct animals of Montmartre from frag-\nments of their bones. Nor does that process of induction\nand deduction by which a lady, finding a stain of a par-\nticular kind upon her dress, concludes that somebody\nhas upset the inkstand thereon, differ in any way from\nthat by which Adams and Leverrier discovered a new\n18.G.C.V.

It is proper cre-\nation.\u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nature.\nLike other valuable resources in public speaking, description\nloses its power when carried to an extreme. Over-ornamenta-\ntion makes the subject ridiculous. A dust-cloth is a very useful\nthing, but why embroider it? Whether description shall be re-\nstrained within its proper and important limits, or be encour-\naged to run riot, is the personal choice that comes before every\nspeaker, for man's earliest literary tendency is to depict.\nThe Nature of Description\nTo describe is to call up a picture in the mind of the hearer.\n\"In talking of description we naturally speak of portraying, de-\nlineating, coloring, and all the devices of the picture painter.\nTo describe is to visualize, hence we must look at description\nas a pictorial process, whether the writer deals with material\nor with spiritual objects.\"20\n20.Writing the Short-Story, J. Berg Esenwein.\n192\nIf you were asked to describe the rapid-fire gun you might go\nabout it in either of two ways: give a cold technical account of\nits mechanism, in whole and in detail, or else describe it as a\nterrible engine of slaughter, dwelling upon its effects rather\nthan upon its structure.\nThe former of these processes is exposition, the latter is true\ndescription. Exposition deals more with the general, while de-\nscription must deal with the particular. Exposition elucid-\nates ideas, description treats of things. Exposition deals with\nthe abstract, description with the concrete. Exposition is con-\ncerned with the internal, description with the external. Exposi-\ntion\nExposition\nis intellectual, description sensory. Exposition is impersonal,\ndescription personal.\ndescription literary.\nis enumerative,\nIf description is a visualizing process for the hearer, it is first\nof all such for the speaker\u2014he cannot describe what he has\nnever seen, either physically or in fancy. It is this personal\nquality\u2014this question of the personal eye which sees the things\nlater to be described\u2014that makes description so interesting in\npublic speech. Given a speaker of personality, and we are in-\nterested in his personal view\u2014his view adds to the natural in-\nterest of the scene, and may even be the sole source of that in-\nterest to his auditors.\nThe seeing eye has been praised in an earlier chapter (on\n\"Subject and Preparation\") and the imagination will be treated\nin a subsequent one (on \"Riding the Winged Horse\"), but here\nwe must consider the picturing mind: the mind that forms the\ndouble habit of seeing things clearly\u2014for we see more with the\nmind than we do with the physical eye\u2014and then of re-imaging\nthese things for the purpose of getting them before the minds'\neyes of the hearers. No habit is more useful than that of visual-\nizing clearly the object, the scene, the situation, the action, the\nperson, about to be described. Unless that primary process is\ncarried out clearly, the picture will be blurred for the hearer-\nbeholder.\nIn a work of this nature we are concerned with the rhetorical\nanalysis of description, and with its methods, only so far as\nmay be needed for the practical purposes of the speaker.21 The\ntherefore, will not be regarded as\nfollowing grouping,\n193\ncomplete, nor will it here be necessary to add more than a\nword of explanation:\nDescription for Public Speakers\n{ Still\n{ In motion\n{ Still\n{ Including action\nObjects\nObjects\nScenes\nScenes\nSituations { Preceding change\nSituations { During change\nSituations { After change\nActions\nActions\nPersons\nPersons\n{ Mental\n{Physical\n{ Internal\n{ External\nSome of the foregoing processes will overlap, in certain in-\nstances, and all are more likely to be found in combination\nthan singly.\nWhen description is intended solely to give accurate informa-\ntion\u2014as to delineate the appearance, not the technical con-\nstruction, of the latest Zeppelin airship\u2014it is called \"scientific\ndescription,\" and is akin to exposition. When it is intended to\npresent a free picture for the purpose of making a vivid impres-\nsion, it is called \"artistic description.\" With both of these the\npublic speaker has to deal, but more frequently with the latter\nform. Rhetoricians make still further distinctions.\nMethods of Description\nIn public speaking, description should be mainly by sugges-\ntion, not only because suggestive description is so much more\ncompact and time-saving but because it is so vivid. Suggestive\nexpressions connote more than they literally say\u2014they suggest\nideas and pictures to the mind of the hearer which supplement\nthe direct words of the speaker. When Dickens, in his \"Christ-\nmas Carol,\" says: \"In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial\nsmile,\" our minds complete the picture so deftly begun\u2014a\nmuch more effective process than that of a minutely detailed\ndescription because it leaves a unified, vivid impression, and\n21.For fuller treatment of Description see Genung's Working Principles of\nRhetoric, Albright's Descriptive Writing, Bates' Talks on Writing English,\nfirst and second series, and any advanced rhetoric.\n194\nthat is what we need. Here is a present-day bit of suggestion:\n\"General Trinkle was a gnarly oak of a man\u2014rough, solid, and\nsafe; you always knew where to find him.\" Dickens presents\nMiss Peecher as: \"A little pin-cushion, a little housewife, a little\nbook, a little work-box, a little set of tables and weights and\nmeasures,\nIn his\nlittle woman all\n\"Knickerbocker's\" \"History of New York,\" Irving portrays\nWouter van Twiller as \"a robustious beer-barrel, standing on\nskids.\"\nin one.\"\nand a\nWhatever forms of description you neglect, be sure to master\nthe art of suggestion.\nDescription may be by simple hint. Lowell notes a happy in-\nstance of this sort of picturing by intimation when he says of\nChaucer: \"Sometimes he describes amply by the merest hint,\nas where the Friar, before setting himself down, drives away\nthe cat. We know without need of more words that he has\nchosen the snuggest corner.\"\nDescription may depict a thing by its effects. \"When the\nspectator's eye is dazzled, and he shades it,\" says Mozley in his\n\"Essays,\" \"we form the idea of a splendid object; when his face\nturns pale, of a horrible one; from his quick wonder and admir-\nation we form the idea of great beauty; from his silent awe, of\ngreat majesty.\"\nBrief description may be by epithet. \"Blue-eyed,\" \"white-\narmed,\" \"laughter-loving,\" are now conventional compounds,\nbut they were fresh enough when Homer first conjoined them.\nThe centuries have not yet improved upon \"Wheels round,\nbrazen, eight-spoked,\" or \"Shields smooth, beautiful, brazen,\nwell-hammered.\" Observe the effective use of epithet in Will\nLevington Comfort's \"The Fighting Death,\" when he speaks of\nsoldiers in a Philippine skirmish as being \"leeched against a\nrock.\"\nDescription uses figures of speech. Any advanced rhetoric\nwill discuss their forms and give examples for guidance.22 This\nmatter is most important, be assured. A brilliant yet carefully\nrestrained figurative style, a style marked by brief, pungent,\n22.See also The Art of Versification, J. Berg Esenwein and Mary Eleanor\nRoberts, pp. 28-35; and Writing the Short-Story, J. Berg Esenwein, pp.\n152-162; 231-240.\n195\nwitty, and humorous comparisons and characterizations, is a\nwonderful resource for all kinds of platform work.\nDescription may be direct. This statement is plain enough\nwithout exposition. Use your own judgment as to whether in\npicturing you had better proceed from a general view to the\ndetails, or first give the details and thus build up the general\npicture, but by all means BE BRIEF.\nNote the vivid compactness of these delineations from Wash-\nington Irving's \"Knickerbocker:\"\nHe was a short, square, brawny old gentleman, with a\ndouble chin, a mastiff mouth, and a broad copper nose,\nwhich was supposed in those days to have acquired its\nfiery hue from the constant neighborhood of his tobacco\npipe.\nHe was exactly five feet six inches in height, and six feet\nfive inches in circumference. His head was a perfect\nsphere, and of such stupendous dimensions, that Dame\nNature, with all her sex's ingenuity, would have been\npuzzled to construct a neck capable of supporting it;\nwherefore she wisely declined the attempt, and settled it\nfirmly on the top of his backbone, just between the\nshoulders. His body was of an oblong form, particularly\ncapacious at bottom; which was wisely ordered by\nProvidence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary\nhabits, and very averse to the idle labor of walking.\nThe foregoing is too long for the platform, but it is so good-\nhumored, so full of delightful exaggeration, that it may well\nserve as a model of humorous character picturing, for here one\ninevitably sees the inner man in the outer.\nDirect description for platform use may be made vivid by\nthe sparing use of the \"historical present.\" The following dra-\nmatic passage, accompanied by the most lively action, has\nlingered in the mind for thirty years after hearing Dr. T. De\nWitt Talmage lecture on \"Big Blunders.\" The crack of the bat\nsounds clear even today:\nGet ready the bats and take your positions. Now, give us\nthe ball. Too low. Don't strike. Too high. Don't strike.\nThere it comes like lightning. Strike! Away it soars!\n196\nHigher! Higher! Run! Another base! Faster! Faster!\nGood! All around at one stroke!\nObserve the remarkable way in which the lecturer fused\nspeaker, audience, spectators, and players into one excited, ec-\nstatic whole\u2014just as you have found yourself starting forward\nin your seat at the delivery of the ball with \"three on and two\ndown\" in the ninth inning. Notice, too, how\u2014perhaps uncon-\nsciously\u2014Talmage painted the scene in Homer's characteristic\nstyle: not as having already happened, but as happening before\nyour eyes.\nIf you have attended many travel talks you must have been\nimpressed by the painful extremes to which the lecturers\ngo\u2014with a few notable exceptions, their language is either\nover-ornate or crude. If you would learn the power of words to\nmake scenery, yes, even houses, palpitate with poetry and hu-\nman appeal, read Lafcadio Hearn, Robert Louis Stevenson, Pi-\nerre Loti, and Edmondo De Amicis.\nBlue-distant, a mountain of carven stone appeared be-\nfore them,\u2014the Temple, lifting to heaven its wilderness\nof chiseled pinnacles, flinging to the sky the golden\nspray of its decoration.\n\u2014Lafcadio Hearn, Chinese Ghosts.\nThe stars were clear, colored, and jewel-like, but not\nfrosty. A faint silvery vapour stood for the Milky Way. All\naround me the black fir-points stood upright and stock-\nstill. By the whiteness of the pack-saddle I could see\nModestine walking round and round at the length of her\ntether; I could hear her steadily munching at the sward;\nbut there was not another sound save the indescribable\nquiet talk of the runnel over the stones.\n\u2014Robert Louis Stevenson, Travels with a Donkey.\nIt was full autumn now, late autumn\u2014with the nightfalls\ngloomy, and all things growing dark early in the old cot-\ntage, and all the Breton land looking sombre, too. The\nvery days seemed but twilight; immeasurable clouds,\nslowly passing, would suddenly bring darkness at broad\nnoon. The wind moaned constantly\u2014it was like the\nsound of a great cathedral organ at a distance, but\n197\nplaying profane airs, or despairing dirges; at other times\nit would come close to the door, and lift up a howl like\nwild beasts.\u2014Pierre Loti, An Iceland Fisherman.\nI see the great refectory,23 where a battalion might have\ndrilled; I see the long tables, the five hundred heads bent\nabove the plates, the rapid motion of five hundred forks,\nof a thousand hands, and sixteen thousand teeth; the\nswarm of servants running here and there, called to,\nscolded, hurried, on every side at once; I hear the clatter\nof dishes, the deafening noise, the voices choked with\nfood crying out: \"Bread\u2014bread!\" and I feel once more\nthe formidable appetite, the herculean strength of jaw,\nthe exuberant life and spirits of those far-off days.24\n\u2014Edmondo De Amicis, College Friends.\nSuggestions for the Use of Description\nDecide, on beginning a description, what point of view you\nwish your hearers to take. One cannot see either a mountain or\na man on all sides at once. Establish a view-point, and do not\nshift without giving notice.\nChoose an attitude toward your subject\u2014shall it be ideal-\nized? caricatured? ridiculed? exaggerated? defended? or de-\nscribed impartially?\nBe sure of your mood, too, for it will color the subject to be\ndescribed. Melancholy will make a rose-garden look gray.\nAdopt an order in which you will proceed\u2014do not shift back-\nward and forward from near to far, remote to close in time,\ngeneral to particular, large to small, important to unimportant,\nconcrete to abstract, physical\nfollow your\nchosen order. Scattered and shifting observations produce\nhazy impressions just as a moving camera spoils the time-\nexposure.\nto mental; but\nDo not go into needless minuti\u00e6. Some details identify a\nthing with its class, while other details differentiate it from its\nclass. Choose only the significant, suggestive characteristics\nand bring those out with terse vividness. Learn a lesson from\nthe few strokes used by the poster artist.\n23.In the Military College of Modena.\n24.This figure of speech is known as \"Vision.\"\n198\nIn determining what to describe and what merely to name,\nseek to read the knowledge of your audience. The difference to\nthem between the unknown and the known is a vital one also to\nyou.\nRelentlessly cut out all ideas and words not necessary to pro-\nduce the effect you desire. Each element in a mental picture\neither helps or hinders. Be sure they do not hinder, for they\ncannot be passively present in any discourse.\nInterruptions of the description to make side-remarks are as\npowerful to destroy unity as are scattered descriptive phrases.\nThe only visual impression that can be effective is one that is\nunified.\nIn describing, try to call up the emotions you felt when first\nyou saw the scene, and then try to reproduce those emotions in\nyour hearers. Description is primarily emotional in its appeal;\nnothing can be more deadly dull than a cold, unemotional out-\nline, while nothing leaves a warmer impression than a glowing,\nspirited description.\nGive a swift and vivid general view at the close of the por-\ntrayal. First and final\nimpressions remain the longest. The\nmind may be trained to take in the characteristic points of a\nsubject, so as to view in a single scene, action, experience, or\ncharacter, a unified impression of the whole. To describe a\nthing as a whole you must first see it as a whole. Master that\nart and you have mastered description to the last degree.\nSELECTIONS FOR PRACTISE\nTHE HOMES OF THE PEOPLE\nI went to Washington the other day, and I stood on the\nCapitol Hill; my heart beat quick as I looked at the\ntowering marble of my country's Capitol and the mist\ngathered in my eyes as I thought of its tremendous signi-\nficance, and the armies and the treasury, and the judges\nand the President, and the Congress and the courts, and\nall that was gathered there. And I felt that the sun in all\nits course could not look down on a better sight than\nthat majestic home of a republic that had taught the\nworld its best lessons of liberty. And I felt that if honor\nand wisdom and justice abided therein, the world would\nat last owe to that great house in which the ark of the\n199\ncovenant of my country is lodged, its final uplifting and\nits regeneration.\nTwo days afterward, I went to visit a friend in the coun-\ntry, a modest man, with a quiet country home. It was just\na simple, unpretentious house, set about with big trees,\nencircled in meadow and field rich with the promise of\nharvest. The fragrance of the pink and hollyhock in the\nfront yard was mingled with the aroma of the orchard\nand of the gardens, and resonant with the cluck of\npoultry and the hum of bees.\nInside was quiet, cleanliness, thrift, and comfort. There\nwas the old clock that had welcomed, in steady measure,\nevery newcomer to the family, that had ticked the sol-\nemn requiem of the dead, and had kept company with\nthe watcher at the bedside. There were the big, restful\nbeds and the old, open fireplace, and the old family\nBible, thumbed with the fingers of hands long since still,\nand wet with the tears of eyes long since closed, holding\nthe simple annals of the family and the heart and the\nconscience of the home.\nOutside, there stood my friend, the master, a simple, up-\nright man, with no mortgage on his roof, no lien on his\ngrowing crops, master of his land and master of himself.\nThere was his old father, an aged, trembling man, but\nhappy in the heart and home of his son. And as they star-\nted to their home, the hands of the old man went down\non the young man's shoulder, laying there the unspeak-\nable blessing of the honored and grateful father and en-\nnobling it with the knighthood of the fifth\ncommandment.\nAnd as they reached the door the old mother came with\nthe sunset falling fair on her face, and lighting up her\ndeep, patient eyes, while her lips, trembling with the\nrich music of her heart, bade her husband and son wel-\ncome to their home. Beyond was the housewife, busy\nwith her household cares, clean of heart and conscience,\nthe buckler and helpmeet of her husband. Down the lane\ncame the children, trooping home after the cows, seek-\ning as truant birds do the quiet of their home nest.\n200\nAnd I saw the night come down on that house, falling\ngently as the wings of the unseen dove. And the old\nman\u2014while a startled bird called from the forest, and\nthe trees were shrill with the cricket's cry, and the stars\nwere swarming in the sky\u2014got the family around him,\nand, taking the old Bible from the table, called them to\ntheir knees, the little baby hiding in the folds of its\nmother's dress, while he closed the record of that simple\nday by calling down God's benediction on that family and\nthat home. And while I gazed, the vision of that marble\nCapitol faded. Forgotten were its treasures and its\nmajesty and I said, \"Oh, surely here in the homes of the\npeople are lodged at last the strength and the responsib-\nility of this government, the hope and the promise of this\nrepublic.\"\u2014Henry W. Grady.\nSUGGESTIVE SCENES\nOne thing in life calls for another; there is a fitness in\nevents and places. The sight of a pleasant arbor puts it\nin our mind to sit there. One place suggests work, anoth-\ner idleness, a third early rising and long rambles in the\ndew. The effect of night, of any flowing water, of lighted\ncities, of the peep of day, of ships, of the open ocean,\ncalls up in the mind an army of anonymous desires and\npleasures. Something, we feel, should happen; we know\nnot what, yet we proceed in quest of it. And many of the\nhappiest hours in life fleet by us in this vain attendance\non the genius of the place and moment. It is thus that\ntracts of young fir, and low rocks that reach into deep\nsoundings, particularly delight and torture me. So-\nmething must have happened in such places, and per-\nhaps ages back, to members of my race; and when I was\na child I tried to invent appropriate games for them, as I\nstill try, just as vainly, to fit them with the proper story.\nSome places speak distinctly. Certain dank gardens cry\naloud for a murder; certain old houses demand to be\nhaunted; certain coasts are set aside for shipwreck. Oth-\ner spots again seem to abide their destiny, suggestive\nand impenetrable, \"miching mallecho.\" The inn at\nBurford Bridge, with its arbours and green garden and\nsilent, eddying river\u2014though it is known already as the\n201\nplace where Keats wrote some of his Endymion and Nel-\nson parted from his Emma\u2014still seems to wait the com-\ning of the appropriate legend. Within these ivied walls,\nbehind these old green shutters, some further business\nsmoulders, waiting for its hour. The old Hawes Inn at the\nQueen's ferry makes a similar call upon my fancy. There\nit stands, apart from the town, beside the pier, in a cli-\nmate of its own, half inland, half marine\u2014in front, the\nferry bubbling with the tide and the guard-ship swinging\nto her anchor; behind, the old garden with the trees.\nAmericans seek it already for the sake of Lovel and Old-\nbuck, who dined there at the beginning of the Antiquary.\nBut you need not tell me\u2014that is not all; there is some\nstory, unrecorded or not yet complete, which must ex-\npress the meaning of that inn more fully\u2026 . I have lived\nboth at the Hawes and Burford in a perpetual flutter, on\nthe heel, as it seemed, of some adventure that should\njustify the place; but though the feeling had me to bed at\nnight and called me again at morning in one unbroken\nround of pleasure and suspense, nothing befell me in\neither worth remark. The man or the hour had not yet\ncome; but some day, I think, a boat shall put off from the\nQueen's ferry, fraught with a dear cargo, and some\nfrosty night a horseman, on a tragic errand, rattle with\nhis whip upon the green shutters at the inn at Burford.\n\u2014R.L. Stevenson, A Gossip on Romance.\nFROM \"MIDNIGHT IN LONDON\"\nClang! Clang! Clang! the fire-bells! Bing! Bing! Bing! the\nalarm! In an instant quiet turns to uproar\u2014an outburst\nof noise, excitement, clamor\u2014bedlam broke loose; Bing!\nBing! Bing! Rattle, clash and clatter. Open fly the doors;\nbrave men mount their boxes. Bing! Bing! Bing! They're\noff! The horses tear down the street like mad. Bing!\nBing! Bing! goes the gong!\n\"Get out of the track! The engines are coming! For God's\nsake, snatch that child from the road!\"\nOn, on, wildly, resolutely, madly fly the steeds. Bing!\nBing! the gong. Away dash the horses on the wings of\nfevered fury. On whirls the machine, down streets,\naround corners, up this avenue and across that one, out\n202\ninto the very bowels of darkness, whiffing, wheezing,\nshooting a million sparks from the stack, paving the path\nof startled night with a galaxy of stars. Over the house-\ntops to the north, a volcanic burst of flame shoots out,\nbelching with blinding effect. The sky is ablaze. A tene-\nment house is burning. Five hundred souls are in peril.\nMerciful Heaven! Spare the victims! Are the engines\ncoming? Yes, here they are, dashing down the street.\nLook! the horses ride upon the wind; eyes bulging like\nballs of fire; nostrils wide open. A palpitating billow of\nfire, rolling, plunging, bounding rising, falling, swelling,\nheaving, and with mad passion bursting its red-hot sides\nasunder, reaching out its arms, encircling, squeezing,\ngrabbing up, swallowing everything before it with the\nhot, greedy mouth of an appalling monster.\nHow the horses dash around the corner! Animal instinct\nsay you? Aye, more. Brute reason.\n\"Up the ladders, men!\"\nThe towering building is buried in bloated banks of sav-\nage, biting elements. Forked tongues dart out and in,\ndodge here and there, up and down, and wind their cut-\nting edges around every object. A crash, a dull, explosive\nsound, and a puff of smoke leaps out. At the highest\npoint upon the roof stands a dark figure in a desperate\nstrait, the hands making frantic gestures, the arms\nswinging wildly\u2014and then the body shoots off into fright-\nful space, plunging upon the pavement with a revolting\nthud. The man's arm strikes a bystander as he darts\ndown. The crowd shudders, sways, and utters a low mur-\nmur of pity and horror. The faint-hearted lookers-on hide\ntheir faces. One woman swoons away.\n\"Poor fellow! Dead!\" exclaims a laborer, as he looks upon\nthe man's body.\n\"Aye, Joe, and I knew him well, too! He lived next door to\nme, five flights back. He leaves a widowed mother and\ntwo wee bits of orphans. I helped him bury his wife a\nfortnight ago. Ah, Joe! but it's hard lines for the\norphans.\"\n203\nA ghastly hour moves on, dragging its regiment of panic\nin its trail and leaving crimson blotches of cruelty along\nthe path of night.\n\"Are they all out, firemen?\"\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\"\n\"No, they're not! There's a woman in the top window\nholding a child in her arms\u2014over yonder in the right-\nhand corner! The ladders, there! A hundred pounds to\nthe man who makes the rescue!\"\nA dozen start. One man more supple than the others, and\nreckless in his bravery, clambers to the top rung of the\nladder.\n\"Too short!\" he cries. \"Hoist another!\"\nUp it goes. He mounts to the window, fastens the rope,\nlashes mother and babe, swings them off into ugly empti-\nness, and lets them down to be rescued by his comrades.\n\"Bravo, fireman!\" shouts the crowd.\nA crash breaks through the uproar of crackling timbers.\n\"Look alive, up there! Great God! The roof has fallen!\"\nThe walls sway, rock, and tumble in with a deafening\nroar. The spectators cease to breathe. The cold truth re-\nveals itself. The fireman has been carried into the seeth-\ning furnace. An old woman, bent with the weight of age,\nrushes through the fire line, shrieking, raving, and\nwringing her hands and opening her heart of grief.\n\"Poor John! He was all I had! And a brave lad he was,\ntoo! But he's gone now. He lost his own life in savin' two\nmore, and now\u2014now he's there, away in there!\" she re-\npeats, pointing to the cruel oven.\nThe engines do their work. The flames die out.

So did his person, which was sleek though\nfree from corpulency. So did his manner, which was soft\nand oily.

The principle consists in making the appropriate\nthought follow the appropriate thought, the proper fact\nthe proper fact; in first preparing the mind for what is to\ncome, and then letting it come.\u2014Walter Bagehot, Liter-\nary Studies.\nOur very speech is curiously historical. Most men, you\nmay observe, speak only to narrate; not in imparting\nwhat they have thought, which indeed were often a very\nsmall matter, but in exhibiting what they have under-\ngone or seen, which is a quite unlimited one, do talkers\ndilate. Cut us off from Narrative, how would the stream\nof conversation, even among the wisest, languish into\ndetached handfuls, and among the foolish utterly evapor-\nate! Thus, as we do nothing but enact History, we say\nlittle but recite it.\u2014Thomas Carlyle, On History.\nOnly a small segment of the great field of narration offers its\nresources to the public speaker, and that includes the anec-\ndote, biographical facts, and the narration of events in general.\nNarration\u2014more easily defined than mastered\u2014is the recital\nof an incident, or a group of facts and occurrences, in such a\nmanner as to produce a desired effect.\nThe laws of narration are few, but its successful practise in-\nvolves more of art than would at first appear\u2014so much, indeed,\nthat we cannot even touch upon its technique here, but must\ncontent ourselves with an examination of a few examples of\nnarration as used in public speech.\nIn a preliminary way, notice how radically the public\nspeaker's use of narrative differs from that of the story-writer\nin the more limited scope, absence of extended dialogue and\n207\ncharacter drawing, and freedom from elaboration of detail,\nwhich characterize platform narrative. On the other hand,\nthere are several similarities of method: the frequent combina-\ntion of narration with exposition, description, argumentation,\nand pleading; the care exercised in the arrangement of materi-\nal so as to produce a strong effect at the close (climax); the\nvery general practise of concealing the \"point\" (d\u00e9nouement) of\na story until the effective moment; and the careful suppression\nof needless, and therefore hurtful, details.\nSo we see that, whether for magazine or platform, the art of\nnarration involves far more than the recital of annals; the suc-\ncession of events recorded requires a plan in order to bring\nthem out with real effect.\nIt will be noticed, too, that the literary style in platform nar-\nration is likely to be either less polished and more vigorously\ndramatic than in that intended for publication, or else more\nfervid and elevated in tone. In this latter respect, however, the\nbest platform speaking of today differs from the models of the\npreceding generation, wherein a highly dignified, and some-\ntimes pompous, style was thought the only fitting dress for a\npublic deliverance. Great, noble and stirring as these older\nmasters were in their lofty and impassioned eloquence, we are\nsometimes oppressed when we read their sounding periods for\nany great length of time\u2014even allowing for all that we lose by\nmissing the speaker's presence, voice, and fire. So let us model\nour platform narration, as our other forms of speech, upon the\neffective addresses of the moderns, without lessening our ad-\nmiration for the older school.\nThe Anecdote\nAn anecdote is a short narrative of a single event, told as be-\ning striking enough to bring out a point. The keener the point,\nthe more condensed the form, and the more suddenly the ap-\nplication strikes the hearer, the better the story.\nTo regard an anecdote as an illustration\u2014an interpretive pic-\nture\u2014will help to hold us to its true purpose, for a purposeless\nstory is of all offenses on the platform the most asinine. A per-\nfectly capital joke will fall flat when it is dragged in by the nape\nwithout evident bearing on the subject under discussion. On\nthe other hand, an apposite anecdote has saved many a speech\nfrom failure.\n208\n\"There is no finer opportunity for the display of tact than in\nthe introduction of witty or humorous stories into a discourse.\nWit is keen and like a rapier, piercing deeply, sometimes even\nto the heart. Humor is good-natured, and does not wound. Wit\nis founded upon the sudden discovery of an unsuspected rela-\ntion existing between two ideas. Humor deals with things out\nof relation\u2014with the incongruous. It was wit in Douglass Jer-\nrold to retort upon the scowl of a stranger whose shoulder he\nhad familiarly slapped, mistaking him for a friend: 'I beg your\npardon, I thought I knew you\u2014but I'm glad I don't.' It was hu-\nmor in the Southern orator, John Wise, to liken the pleasure of\nspending an evening with a Puritan girl to that of sitting on a\nblock of ice in winter, cracking hailstones between his teeth.\"25\nThe foregoing quotation has been introduced chiefly to illus-\ntrate the first and simplest form of anecdote\u2014the single sen-\ntence embodying a pungent saying.\nAnother simple form is that which conveys its meaning\nwithout need of \"application,\" as the old preachers used to say.\nGeorge Ade has quoted this one as the best joke he ever heard:\nTwo solemn-looking gentlemen were riding together in a\nrailway carriage. One gentleman said to the other: \"Is\nyour wife entertaining this summer?\" Whereupon the\nother gentleman replied: \"Not very.\"\nOther anecdotes need harnessing to the particular truth the\nspeaker wishes to carry along in his talk. Sometimes the ap-\nplication is made before the story is told and the audience is\nprepared to make the comparison, point by point, as the illus-\ntration is told. Henry W. Grady used this method in one of the\nanecdotes he told while delivering his great extemporaneous\naddress, \"The New South.\"\nAge does not endow all things with strength and virtue,\nnor are all new things to be despised. The shoemaker\nwho put over his door, \"John Smith's shop, founded\n1760,\" was more than matched by his young rival across\nthe street who hung out this sign: \"Bill Jones. Estab-\nlished 1886. No old stock kept in this shop.\"\n25.How to Attract and Hold an Audience, J. Berg Esenwein.\n209\nIn two anecdotes, told also in \"The New South,\" Mr. Grady il-\nlustrated another way of enforcing the application: in both in-\nstances he split the idea he wished to drive home, bringing in\npart before and part after the recital of the story. The fact that\nthe speaker misquoted the words of Genesis in which the Ark is\ndescribed did not seem to detract from the burlesque humor of\nthe story.\nI bespeak the utmost stretch of your courtesy tonight. I\nam not troubled about those from whom I come. You re-\nmember the man whose wife sent him to a neighbor with\na pitcher of milk, who, tripping on the top step, fell, with\nsuch casual interruptions as the landings afforded, into\nthe basement, and, while picking himself up, had the\npleasure of hearing his wife call out:\n\"John, did you break the pitcher?\n\"No, I didn't,\" said John, \"but I be dinged if I don't.\"\nSo, while those who call to me from behind may inspire\nme with energy, if not with courage, I ask an indulgent\nhearing from you. I beg that you will bring your full faith\nin American fairness and frankness to judgment upon\nwhat I shall say. There was an old preacher once who\ntold some boys of the Bible lesson he was going to read\nin the morning. The boys, finding the place, glued to-\ngether the connecting pages. The next morning he read\non the bottom of one page: \"When Noah was one hun-\ndred and twenty years old he took unto himself a wife,\nwho was\"\u2014then turning the page\u2014\"one hundred and\nforty cubits long, forty cubits wide, built of gopher wood,\nand covered with pitch inside and out.\" He was naturally\npuzzled at this. He read it again, verified it, and then\nsaid, \"My friends, this is the first time I ever met this in\nthe Bible, but I accept it as an evidence of the assertion\nthat we are fearfully and wonderfully made.\" If I could\nget you to hold such faith to-night, I could proceed\ncheerfully to the task I otherwise approach with a sense\nof consecration.\n210\nNow and then a speaker will plunge without introduction into\nan anecdote, leaving the application to follow. The following il-\nlustrates this method:\nA large, slew-footed darky was leaning against the\ncorner of the railroad station in a Texas town when the\nnoon whistle in the canning factory blew and the hands\nhurried out, bearing their grub buckets. The darky\nlistened, with his head on one side until the rocketing\necho had quite died away. Then he heaved a deep sigh\nand remarked to himself:\n\"Dar she go. Dinner time for some folks\u2014but jes' 12\no'clock fur me!\"\nThat is the situation in thousands of American factories,\nlarge and small, today. And why? etc., etc.\nDoubtless the most frequent platform use of the anecdote is\nin the pulpit. The sermon \"illustration,\" however, is not always\nstrictly narrative in form, but tends to extended comparison, as\nthe following from Dr. Alexander Maclaren:\nMen will stand as Indian fakirs do, with their arms above\ntheir heads until they stiffen there. They will perch them-\nselves upon pillars like Simeon Stylites, for years, till the\nbirds build their nests in their hair. They will measure all\nthe distance from Cape Comorin to Juggernaut's temple\nwith their bodies along the dusty road. They will wear\nhair shirts and scourge themselves. They will fast and\ndeny themselves. They will build cathedrals and endow\nchurches. They will do as many of you do, labor by fits\nand starts all thru your lives at the endless task of mak-\ning yourselves ready for heaven, and winning it by obedi-\nence and by righteousness. They will do all these things\nand do them gladly, rather than listen to the humbling\nmessage that says, \"You do not need to do any-\nthing\u2014wash.\" Is it your washing, or the water, that will\nclean you? Wash and be clean! Naaman's cleaning was\nonly a test of his obedience, and a token that it was God\nwho cleansed him. There was no power in Jordan's wa-\nters to take away the taint of leprosy. Our cleansing is in\nthat blood of Jesus Christ that has the power to take\n211\naway all sin, and to make the foulest amongst us pure\nand clean.\nOne final word must be said about the introduction to the an-\necdote. A clumsy, inappropriate introduction is fatal, whereas a\nsingle apt or witty sentence will kindle interest and prepare a\nfavorable hearing. The following extreme illustration, by the\nEnglish humorist, Captain Harry Graham, well satirizes the\nstumbling manner:\nThe best story that I ever heard was one that I was told\nonce in the fall of 1905 (or it may have been 1906), when\nI was visiting Boston\u2014at least, I think it was Boston; it\nmay have been Washington (my memory is so bad).\nI happened to run across a most amusing man whose\nname I forget\u2014Williams or Wilson or Wilkins; some\nname like that\u2014and he told me this story while we were\nwaiting for a trolley car.\nI can still remember how heartily I laughed at the time;\nand again, that evening, after I had gone to bed, how I\nlaughed myself to sleep recalling the humor of this in-\ncredibly humorous story. It was really quite extraordin-\narily funny. In fact, I can truthfully affirm that it is quite\nthe most amusing story I have ever had the privilege of\nhearing. Unfortunately, I've forgotten it.\nBiographical Facts\nPublic speaking has much to do with personalities; naturally,\ntherefore, the narration of a series of biographical details, in-\ncluding anecdotes among the recital of interesting facts, plays\na large part in the eulogy, the memorial address, the political\nspeech, the sermon, the lecture, and other platform deliver-\nances. Whole addresses may be made up of such biographical\ndetails, such as a sermon on \"Moses,\" or a lecture on \"Lee.\"\nThe following example is in itself an expanded anecdote,\nforming a link in a chain:\nMARIUS IN PRISON\nThe peculiar sublimity of the Roman mind does not ex-\npress itself, nor is it at all to be sought, in their poetry.\nPoetry, according to the Roman ideal of it, was not an\n212\nadequate organ for the grander movements of the na-\ntional mind. Roman sublimity must be looked for in Ro-\nman acts, and in Roman sayings. Where, again, will you\nfind a more adequate expression of the Roman majesty,\nthan in the saying of Trajan\u2014Imperatorem oportere\nstantem mori\u2014that C\u00e6sar ought to die standing; a\nspeech of imperatorial grandeur! Implying that he, who\nwas \"the foremost man of all this world,\"\u2014and, in regard\nto all other nations, the representative of his\nown,\u2014should express its characteristic virtue in his\nfarewell act\u2014should die in procinctu\u2014and should meet\nthe last enemy as the first, with a Roman countenance\nand in a soldier's attitude. If this had an imperatori-\nal\u2014what follows had a consular majesty, and is almost\nthe grandest story upon record.\nMarius, the man who rose to be seven times consul, was\nin a dungeon, and a slave was sent in with commission to\nput him to death. These were the persons,\u2014the two ex-\ntremities of exalted and forlorn humanity, its vanward\nand its rearward man, a Roman consul and an abject\nslave. But their natural relations to each other were, by\nthe caprice of fortune, monstrously inverted: the consul\nwas in chains; the slave was for a moment the arbiter of\nhis fate. By what spells, what magic, did Marius rein-\nstate himself in his natural prerogatives? By what mar-\nvels drawn from heaven or from earth, did he, in the\ntwinkling of an eye, again invest himself with the purple,\nand place between himself and his assassin a host of\nshadowy lictors? By the mere blank supremacy of great\nminds over weak ones. He fascinated the slave, as a\nrattlesnake does a bird. Standing \"like Teneriffe,\" he\nsmote him with his eye, and said, \"Tune, homo, audes oc-\ncidere C. Marium?\"\u2014\"Dost thou, fellow, presume to kill\nCaius Marius?\" Whereat, the reptile, quaking under the\nvoice, nor daring to affront the consular eye, sank gently\nto the ground\u2014turned round upon his hands and\nfeet\u2014and, crawling out of the prison like any other ver-\nmin, left Marius standing in solitude as steadfast and im-\nmovable as the capitol.\n\u2014Thomas De Quincy.\n213\nHere is a similar example, prefaced by a general historical\nstatement and concluding with autobiographical details:\nA REMINISCENCE OF LEXINGTON\nOne raw morning in spring\u2014it will be eighty years the\n19th day of this month\u2014Hancock and Adams, the Moses\nand Aaron of that Great Deliverance, were both at Lex-\nington; they also had \"obstructed an officer\" with brave\nwords. British soldiers, a thousand strong, came to seize\nthem and carry them over sea for trial, and so nip the\nbud of Freedom auspiciously opening in that early\nspring. The town militia came together before daylight,\n\"for training.\" A great, tall man, with a large head and a\nhigh, wide brow, their captain,\u2014one who had \"seen ser-\nvice,\"\u2014marshalled them into line, numbering but sev-\nenty, and bade \"every man load his piece with powder\nand ball. I will order the first man shot that runs away,\"\nsaid he, when some faltered. \"Don't fire unless fired\nupon, but if they want to have a war, let it begin here.\"\nGentlemen, you know what followed; those farmers and\nmechanics \"fired the shot heard round the world.\" A\nlittle monument covers the bones of such as before had\npledged their fortune and their sacred honor to the Free-\ndom of America, and that day gave it also their lives. I\nwas born in that little town, and bred up amid the\nmemories of that day. When a boy, my mother lifted me\nup, one Sunday, in her religious, patriotic arms, and held\nme while I read the first monumental line I ever\nsaw\u2014\"Sacred to Liberty and the Rights of Mankind.\"\nSince then I have studied the memorial marbles of\nGreece and Rome, in many an ancient town; nay, on\nEgyptian obelisks have read what was written before the\nEternal raised up Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt; but\nno chiseled stone has ever stirred me to such emotion as\nthese rustic names of men who fell \"In the Sacred Cause\nof God and their Country.\"\nGentlemen, the Spirit of Liberty, the Love of Justice,\nwere early fanned into a flame in my boyish heart. That\nmonument covers the bones of my own kinsfolk; it was\ntheir blood which reddened the long, green grass at\n214\nLexington. It was my own name which stands chiseled on\nthat stone; the tall captain who marshalled his fellow\nfarmers and mechanics into stern array, and spoke such\nbrave and dangerous words as opened the war of Amer-\nican Independence,\u2014the last to leave the field,\u2014was my\nfather's father. I learned to read out of his Bible, and\nwith a musket he that day captured from the foe, I\nlearned another religious lesson, that \"Rebellion to\nTyrants is Obedience to God.\" I keep them both \"Sacred\nto Liberty and the Rights of Mankind,\" to use them both\n\"In the Sacred Cause of God and my Coun-\ntry.\"\u2014Theodore Parker.\nNarration of Events in General\nIn this wider, emancipated narration we find much mingling\nof other forms of discourse, greatly to the advantage of the\nspeech, for this truth cannot be too strongly emphasized: The\nefficient speaker cuts loose from form for the sake of a big,\nfree effect. The present analyses are for no other purpose than\nto acquaint you with form\u2014do not allow any such models to\nhang as a weight about your neck.\nThe following pure narration of events, from George William\nCurtis's \"Paul Revere's Ride,\" varies the biographical recital in\nother parts of his famous oration:\nThat evening, at ten o'clock, eight hundred British\ntroops, under Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, took boat at the\nfoot of the Common and crossed to the Cambridge shore.\nGage thought his secret had been kept, but Lord Percy,\nwho had heard the people say on the Common that the\ntroops would miss their aim, undeceived him. Gage in-\nstantly ordered that no one should leave the town. But as\nthe troops crossed the river, Ebenezer Dorr, with a mes-\nsage to Hancock and Adams, was riding over the Neck to\nRoxbury, and Paul Revere was rowing over the river to\nCharlestown, having agreed with his friend, Robert New-\nman, to show lanterns from the belfry of the Old North\nChurch\u2014\"One if by land, and two if by sea\"\u2014as a signal\nof the march of the British.\n215\nThe following, from the same oration, beautifully mingles de-\nscription with narration:\nIt was a brilliant night. The winter had been unusually\nmild, and the spring very forward. The hills were already\ngreen. The early grain waved in the fields, and the air\nwas sweet with the blossoming orchards. Already the\nrobins whistled, the bluebirds sang, and the benediction\nof peace rested upon the landscape. Under the cloudless\nmoon the soldiers silently marched, and Paul Revere\nswiftly rode, galloping through Medford and West Cam-\nbridge, rousing every house as he went spurring for Lex-\nington and Hancock and Adams, and evading the British\npatrols who had been sent out to stop the news.\nIn the succeeding extract from another of Mr. Curtis's ad-\ndresses, we have a free use of allegory as illustration:\nTHE LEADERSHIP OF EDUCATED MEN\nThere is a modern English picture which the genius of\nHawthorne might have inspired. The painter calls it,\n\"How they met themselves.\" A man and a woman, hag-\ngard and weary, wandering lost in a somber wood, sud-\ndenly meet the shadowy figures of a youth and a maid.\nSome mysterious fascination fixes the gaze and stills the\nhearts of the wanderers, and their amazement deepens\ninto awe as they gradually recognize themselves as once\nthey were; the soft bloom of youth upon their rounded\ncheeks, the dewy light of hope in their trusting eyes, ex-\nulting confidence in their springing step, themselves\nblithe and radiant with the glory of the dawn. Today, and\nhere, we meet ourselves. Not to these familiar scenes\nalone\u2014yonder college-green with its reverend traditions;\nthe halcyon cove of the Seekonk, upon which the\nmemory of Roger Williams broods like a bird of calm; the\nhistoric bay, beating forever with the muffled oars of\nBarton and of Abraham Whipple; here, the humming city\nof the living; there, the peaceful city of the dead;\u2014not to\nthese only or chiefly do we return, but to ourselves as we\nonce were. It is not the smiling freshmen of the year, it is\nyour own beardless and unwrinkled faces, that are\n216\nlooking from the windows of University Hall and of Hope\nCollege. Under the trees upon the hill it is yourselves\nwhom you see walking, full of hopes and dreams, glow-\ning with conscious power, and \"nourishing a youth sub-\nlime;\" and in this familiar temple, which surely has never\nechoed with eloquence so fervid and inspiring as that of\nyour commencement orations, it is not yonder youths in\nthe galleries who, as they fondly believe, are whispering\nto yonder maids; it is your younger selves who, in the\ndays that are no more, are murmuring to the fairest\nmothers and grandmothers of those maids.\nHappy the worn and weary man and woman in the pic-\nture could they have felt their older eyes still glistening\nwith that earlier light, and their hearts yet beating with\nundiminished sympathy and aspiration. Happy we,\nbrethren, whatever may have been achieved, whatever\nleft undone, if, returning to the home of our earlier\nyears, we bring with us the illimitable hope, the un-\nchilled resolution, the inextinguishable faith of youth.\n\u2014George William Curtis.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

In view of the hindrances which certain\nkinds or degrees of feeling throw into the way of think-\ning, it might be inferred that the thinker must suppress\nthe element of feeling in the inner life. No greater mis-\ntake could be made. If the Creator endowed man with\nthe power to think, to feel, and to will, these several\nactivities of the mind are not designed to be in conflict,\nand so long as any one of them is not perverted or al-\nlowed to run to excess, it necessarily aids and\nstrengthens the others in their normal functions.\n\u2014Nathan C. Schaeffer, Thinking and Learning to Think.\nWhen we weigh, compare, and decide upon the value of any\ngiven ideas, we reason; when an idea produces in us an opinion\nor an action, without first being subjected to deliberation, we\nare moved by suggestion.\nMan was formerly thought to be a reasoning animal, basing\nhis actions on the conclusions of natural logic. It was supposed\nthat before forming an opinion or deciding on a course of con-\nduct he weighed at least some of the reasons for and against\nthe matter, and performed a more or less simple process of\nreasoning. But modern research has shown that quite the op-\nposite is true. Most of our opinions and actions are not based\nupon conscious reasoning, but are the result of suggestion. In\nfact, some authorities declare that an act of pure reasoning is\nvery rare in the average mind. Momentous decisions are\nmade, far-reaching actions are determined upon, primarily by\nthe force of suggestion.\n219\nNotice that word \"primarily,\" for simple thought, and even\nmature reasoning, often follows a suggestion accepted in the\nmind, and the thinker fondly supposes that his conclusion is\nfrom first to last based on cold logic.\nThe Basis of Suggestion\nWe must think of suggestion both as an effect and as a cause.\nthere must be\nConsidered as an effect, or objectively,\nsomething in the hearer that predisposes him to receive sug-\ngestion; considered as a cause, or subjectively, there must be\nsome methods by which the speaker can move upon that par-\nticularly susceptible attitude of the hearer. How to do this hon-\nestly and fairly is our problem\u2014to do it dishonestly and trickily,\nto use suggestion to bring about conviction and action without\na basis of right and truth and in a bad cause, is to assume the\nterrible responsibility that must fall on the champion of error.\nJesus scorned not to use suggestion so that he might move men\nto their benefit, but every vicious trickster has adopted the\nsame means to reach base ends. Therefore honest men will ex-\namine well into their motives and into the truth of their cause,\nbefore seeking to influence men by suggestion.\nThree fundamental conditions make us all susceptive to\nsuggestion:\nWe naturally respect authority. In every mind this is only a\nquestion of degree, ranging from the subject who is easily hyp-\nnotized to the stubborn mind that fortifies itself the more\nstrongly with every assault upon its opinion. The latter type is\nalmost immune to suggestion.\nOne of the singular things about suggestion is that it is rarely\na fixed quantity. The mind that is receptive to the authority of a\ncertain person may prove inflexible to another; moods and en-\nvironments that produce hypnosis readily in one instance may\nbe entirely inoperative in another; and some minds can\nscarcely ever be thus moved. We do know, however, that the\nfeeling of the subject that authority\u2014influence, power, domina-\ntion, control, whatever you wish to call it\u2014lies in the person of\nthe suggester, is the basis of all suggestion.\nThe extreme force of this influence is demonstrated in hyp-\nnotism. The hypnotic subject is told that he is in the water; he\naccepts the statement as true and makes swimming motions.\nHe is told that a band is marching down the street, playing\n220\n\"The Star Spangled Banner;\" he declares he hears the music,\narises and stands with head bared.\nIn the same way some speakers are able to achieve a modi-\nfied hypnotic effect upon their audiences. The hearers will ap-\nplaud measures and ideas which, after individual reflection,\nthey will repudiate unless such reflection brings the conviction\nthat the first impression is correct.\nA second important principle is that our feelings, thoughts\nand wills tend to follow the line of least resistance. Once open\nthe mind to the sway of one feeling and it requires a greater\npower of feeling, thought, or will\u2014or even all three\u2014to unseat\nit. Our feelings influence our judgments and volitions much\nmore than we care to admit. So true is this that it is a superhu-\nman task to get an audience to reason fairly on a subject on\nwhich it feels deeply, and when this result is accomplished the\nsuccess becomes noteworthy, as in the case of Henry Ward\nBeecher's Liverpool speech. Emotional ideas once accepted are\nsoon cherished, and finally become our very inmost selves. At-\ntitudes based on feelings alone are prejudices.\nWhat is true of our feelings, in this respect, applies to our\nideas: All thoughts that enter the mind tend to be accepted as\ntruth unless a stronger and contradictory thought arises.\nThe speaker skilled in moving men to action manages to\ndominate the minds of his audience with his thoughts by subtly\nprohibiting the entertaining of ideas hostile to his own. Most of\nus are captured by the latest strong attack, and if we can be in-\nduced to act while under the stress of that last insistent\nthought, we lose sight of counter influences. The fact is that al-\nmost all our decisions\u2014if they involve thought at all\u2014are of\nthis sort: At the moment of decision the course of action then\nunder contemplation usurps the attention, and conflicting\nideas are dropped out of consideration.\nThe head of a large publishing house remarked only recently\nthat ninety per cent of the people who bought books by sub-\nscription never read them. They buy because the salesman\npresents his wares so skillfully that every consideration but the\nattractiveness of the book drops out of the mind, and that\nthought prompts action. Every idea that enters the mind will\nresult in action unless a contradictory thought arises to prohib-\nit it. Think of singing the musical scale and it will result in your\n221\nsinging it unless the counter-thought of its futility or absurdity\ninhibits your action. If you bandage and \"doctor\" a horse's foot,\nhe will go lame. You cannot think of swallowing, without the\nmuscles used in that process being affected. You cannot think\nof saying \"hello,\" without a slight movement of the muscles of\nspeech. To warn children that they should not put beans up\ntheir noses is the surest method of getting them to do it. Every\nthought called up in the mind of your audience will work either\nfor or against you. Thoughts are not dead matter; they radiate\ndynamic energy\u2014the thoughts all tend to pass into action.\n\"Thought is another name for fate.\" Dominate your hearers'\nthoughts, allay all contradictory ideas, and you will sway them\nas you wish.\nVolitions as well as feelings and thoughts tend to follow the\nline of least resistance. That is what makes habit. Suggest to a\nman that it is impossible to change his mind and in most cases\nit becomes more difficult to do so\u2014the exception is the man\nwho naturally jumps to the contrary. Counter suggestion is the\nonly way to reach him. Suggest subtly and persistently that the\nopinions of those in the audience who are opposed to your\nviews are changing, and it requires an effort of the will\u2014in\nfact, a summoning of the forces of feeling, thought and will\u2014to\nstem the tide of change that has subconsciously set in.\nBut, not only are we moved by authority, and tend toward\nchannels of least resistance: We are all influenced by our envir-\nonments. It is difficult to rise above the sway of a crowd\u2014its\nenthusiasms and its fears are contagious because they are sug-\ngestive. What so many feel, we say to ourselves, must have\nsome basis in truth. Ten times ten makes more than one hun-\ndred. Set ten men to speaking to ten audiences of ten men\neach, and compare the aggregate power of those ten speakers\nwith that of one man addressing one hundred men. The ten\nspeakers may be more logically convincing than the single\norator, but the chances are strongly in favor of the one man's\nreaching a greater total effect, for the hundred men will radi-\nate conviction and resolution as ten small groups could not. We\nall know the truism about the enthusiasm of numbers. (See the\nchapter on \"Influencing the Crowd.\")\nEnvironment controls us unless the contrary is strongly sug-\ngested. A gloomy day, in a drab room, sparsely tenanted by\n222\nlisteners, invites platform disaster. Everyone feels it in the air.\nBut let the speaker walk squarely up to the issue and suggest\nby all his feeling, manner and words that this is going to be a\ngreat gathering in every vital sense, and see how the suggest-\nive power of environment recedes before the advance of a\nmore potent suggestion\u2014if such the speaker is able to make it.\nNow these three factors\u2014respect for authority, tendency to\nfollow lines of least resistance, and susceptibility to environ-\nment\u2014all help to bring the auditor into a state of mind favor-\nable to suggestive influences, but they also react on the speak-\ner, and now we must consider those personally causative, or\nsubjective,\nforces which enable him to use suggestion\neffectively.\nHow the Speaker Can Make Suggestion Effective\nWe have seen that under the influence of authoritative sug-\ngestion the audience is inclined to accept the speaker's asser-\ntion without argument and criticism. But the audience is not in\nthis state of mind unless it has implicit confidence in the speak-\ner. If they lack faith in him, question his motives or knowledge,\nor even object to his manner they will not be moved by his\nmost logical conclusion and will fail to give him a just hear-\ning. It is all a matter of their confidence in him. Whether the\nspeaker finds it already in the warm, expectant look of his\nhearers, or must win to it against opposition or coldness, he\nmust gain that one great vantage point before his suggestions\ntake on power in the hearts of his listeners. Confidence is the\nmother of Conviction.\nNote in the opening of Henry W. Grady's after-dinner speech\nhow he attempted to secure the confidence of his audience. He\ncreated a receptive atmosphere by a humorous story; ex-\npressed his desire to speak with earnestness and sincerity; ac-\nknowledged \"the vast interests involved;\" deprecated his \"un-\ntried arm,\" and professed his humility. Would not such an in-\ntroduction give you confidence in the speaker, unless you were\nstrongly opposed to him? And even then, would it not partly\ndisarm your antagonism?\nMr. President:\u2014Bidden by your invitation to a discussion\nof the race problem\u2014forbidden by occasion to make a\npolitical speech\u2014I appreciate, in trying to reconcile\n223\norders with propriety, the perplexity of the little maid,\nwho, bidden to learn to swim, was yet adjured, \"Now, go,\nmy darling; hang your clothes on a hickory limb, and\ndon't go near the water.\"\nThe stoutest apostle of the Church, they say, is the mis-\nsionary, and the missionary, wherever he unfurls his\nflag, will never find himself in deeper need of unction\nand address than I, bidden tonight to plant the standard\nof a Southern Democrat in Boston's banquet hall, and to\ndiscuss the problem of the races in the home of Phillips\nand of Sumner. But, Mr. President, if a purpose to speak\nin perfect frankness and sincerity; if earnest understand-\ning of the vast interests involved; if a consecrating sense\nof what disaster may follow further misunderstanding\nand estrangement; if these may be counted to steady un-\ndisciplined speech and to strengthen an untried\narm\u2014then, sir, I shall find the courage to proceed.\nNote also Mr. Bryan's attempt to secure the confidence of his\naudience in the following introduction to his \"Cross of Gold\"\nspeech delivered before the National Democratic Convention in\nChicago, 1896. He asserts his own inability to oppose the \"dis-\ntinguished gentleman;\" he maintains the holiness of his cause;\nand he declares that he will speak in the interest of human-\nity\u2014well knowing that humanity is likely to have confidence in\nthe champion of their rights. This introduction completely dom-\ninated the audience, and the speech made Mr. Bryan famous.\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention: I would\nbe presumptuous indeed to present myself against the\ndistinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened if\nthis were a mere measuring of abilities; but this is not a\ncontest between persons. The humblest citizen in all the\nland, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause, is\nstronger than all the hosts of error. I come to speak to\nyou in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of\nliberty\u2014the cause of humanity.\nSome speakers are able to beget confidence by their very\nmanner, while others can not.\n224\nTo secure confidence, be confident. How can you expect oth-\ners to accept a message in which you lack, or seem to lack,\nfaith yourself? Confidence is as contagious as disease. Napo-\nleon rebuked an officer for using the word \"impossible\" in his\npresence. The speaker who will entertain no idea of defeat be-\ngets in his hearers the idea of his victory. Lady Macbeth was so\nconfident of success that Macbeth changed his mind about un-\ndertaking the assassination. Columbus was so certain in his\nmission that Queen Isabella pawned her jewels to finance his\nexpedition. Assert your message with implicit assurance, and\nyour own belief will act as so much gunpowder to drive it\nhome.\nAdvertisers have long utilized this principle. \"The machine\nyou will eventually buy,\" \"Ask the man who owns one,\" \"Has\nthe strength of Gibraltar,\" are publicity slogans so full of con-\nfidence that they give birth to confidence in the mind of the\nreader.\nIt should\u2014but may not!\u2014go without saying that confidence\nmust have a solid ground of merit or there will be a ridiculous\ncrash. It is all very well for the \"spellbinder\" to claim all the\nprecincts\u2014the official count is just ahead. The reaction against\nto warn those\nover-confidence and over-suggestion ought\nwhose chief asset is mere bluff.\nA short time ago a speaker arose in a public-speaking club\nand asserted that grass would spring from wood-ashes\nsprinkled over the soil, without the aid of seed. This idea was\ngreeted with a laugh, but the speaker was so sure of his posi-\ntion that he reiterated the statement forcefully several times\nand cited his own personal experience as proof. One of the\nmost intelligent men in the audience, who at first had derided\nthe idea, at length came to believe in it. When asked the reas-\non for his sudden change of attitude, he replied: \"Because the\nspeaker is so confident.\" In fact, he was so confident that it\ntook a letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to dis-\nlodge his error.\nIf by a speaker's confidence, intelligent men can be made to\nbelieve such preposterous theories as this where will the\npower of self-reliance cease when plausible propositions are\nunder consideration, advanced with all the power of convincing\nspeech?\n225\nNote the utter assurance in these selections:\nI know not what course others may take, but as for me\ngive me liberty or give me death.\u2014Patrick Henry.\nI ne'er will ask ye quarter, and I ne'er will be your slave;\nBut I'll swim the sea of slaughter, till I sink beneath its\nwave.\n\u2014Patten.\n\u2014Sir Walter Scott\nCome one, come all. This rock shall fly\nFrom its firm base as soon as I.\nINVICTUS\nOut of the night that covers me,\nBlack as the pit from pole to pole,\nI thank whatever Gods may be\nFor my unconquerable soul.\nIn the fell clutch of circumstance\nI have not winced nor cried aloud;\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance\nMy head is bloody, but unbowed.\nBeyond this place of wrath and tears\nLooms but the Horror of the shade,\nAnd yet the menace of the years\nFinds and shall find me unafraid.\nIt matters not how strait the gate,\nHow charged with punishments the scroll,\nI am the master of my fate;\nI am the captain of my soul.\n\u2014William Ernest Henley.\nAuthority is a factor in suggestion. We generally accept as\ntruth, and without criticism, the words of an authority. When\nhe speaks, contradictory ideas rarely arise in the mind to inhib-\nit the action he suggests. A judge of the Supreme Court has the\npower of his words multiplied by the virtue of his position. The\nideas of the U.S. Commissioner of Immigration on his subject\n226\nare much more effective and powerful than those of a soap\nmanufacturer, though the latter may be an able economist.\nThis principle also has been used in advertising. We are told\nthat the physicians to two Kings have recommended Sanato-\ngen. We are informed that the largest bank in America, Tiffany\nand Co., and The State, War, and Navy Departments, all use\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica. The shrewd promoter gives stock\nin his company to influential bankers or business men in the\ncommunity in order that he may use their examples as a selling\nargument.\nIf you wish to influence your audience through suggestion, if\nyou would have your statements accepted without criticism or\nargument, you should appear in the light of an author-\nity\u2014and be one.\nIgnorance and credulity will remain un-\nchanged unless the suggestion of authority be followed\npromptly by facts. Don't claim authority unless you carry your\nlicense in your pocket. Let reason support the position that\nsuggestion has assumed.\nAdvertising will help to establish your reputation\u2014it is \"up to\nyou\" to maintain it. One speaker found that his reputation as a\nmagazine writer was a splendid asset as a speaker. Mr. Bryan's\npublicity, gained by three nominations for the presidency and\nhis position as Secretary of State, helps him to command large\nsums as a speaker. But\u2014back of it all, he is a great speaker.\nNewspaper announcements, all kinds of advertising, formality,\nimpressive introductions, all have a capital effect on the atti-\ntude of the audience. But how ridiculous are all these if a toy\npistol is advertised as a sixteen-inch gun!\nNote how authority is used in the following to support the\nstrength of the speaker's appeal:\nProfessor Alfred Russell Wallace has just celebrated his\n90th birthday. Sharing with Charles Darwin the honor of\ndiscovering evolution, Professor Wallace has lately re-\nceived many and signal honors from scientific societies.\nAt the dinner given him in London his address was\nlargely made up of reminiscences. He reviewed the pro-\ngress of civilization during the last century and made a\nseries of brilliant and startling contrasts between the\nEngland of 1813 and the world of 1913. He affirmed that\n227\nour progress is only seeming and not real. Professor\nWallace insists that the painters, the sculptors, the archi-\ntects of Athens and Rome were so superior to the mod-\nern men that the very fragments of their marbles and\ntemples are the despair of the present day artists. He\ntells us that man has improved his telescope and spec-\ntacles, but that he is losing his eyesight; that man is im-\nproving his looms, but stiffening his fingers; improving\nhis automobile and his locomotive, but losing his legs;\nimproving his foods, butlosing his digestion. He adds\nthat the modern white slave traffic, orphan asylums, and\ntenement house life in factory towns, make a black page\nin the history of the twentieth century.\nProfessor Wallace's views are reinforced by the report of\nthe commission of Parliament on the causes of the de-\nterioration of the factory-class people. In our own coun-\ntry Professor Jordan warns us against war, intemper-\nance, overworking, underfeeding of poor children, and\ndisturbs our contentment with his \"Harvest of Blood.\"\nProfessor Jenks is more pessimistic. He thinks that the\npace, the climate, and the stress of city life, have broken\ndown the Puritan stock, that in another century our old\nfamilies will be extinct, and that the flood of immigration\nmeans a Niagara of muddy waters fouling the pure\nsprings of American life. In his address in New Haven\nProfessor Kellogg calls the roll of the signs of race de-\ngeneracy and tells us that this deterioration even indic-\nates a trend toward race extinction.\n\u2014Newell Dwight Hillis.\nFrom every side come warnings to the American people.\nOur medical journals are filled with danger signals; new\nbooks and magazines, fresh from the press, tell us\nplainly that our people are fronting a social crisis. Mr.\nJefferson, who was once regarded as good Democratic\nauthority, seems to have differed in opinion from the\ngentleman who has addressed us on the part of the\nminority. Those who are opposed to this proposition tell\nus that the issue of paper money is a function of the\nbank, and that the government ought to go out of the\nbanking business. I stand with Jefferson rather than with\n228\nthem, and tell them, as he did, that the issue of money is\na function of government, and that the banks ought to go\nout of the governing business.\n\u2014William Jennings Bryan.\nAuthority is the great weapon against doubt, but even its\nforce can rarely prevail against prejudice and persistent\nwrong-headedness. If any speaker has been able to forge a\nsword that is warranted to piece such armor, let him bless hu-\nmanity by sharing his secret with his platform brethren every-\nwhere, for thus far he is alone in his glory.\nThere is a middle-ground between the suggestion of author-\nity and the confession of weakness that offers a wide range for\ntact in the speaker. No one can advise you when to throw your\n\"hat in the ring\" and say defiantly at the outstart, \"Gentlemen,\nI am here to fight!\" Theodore Roosevelt can do that\u2014Beecher\nwould have been mobbed if he had begun in that style at Liver-\npool. It is for your own tact to decide whether you will use the\ndisarming grace of Henry W. Grady's introduction just quoted\n(even the time-worn joke was ingenuous and seemed to say,\n\"Gentlemen, I come to you with no carefully-palmed coins\"), or\nwhether the solemn gravity of Mr. Bryan before the Convention\nwill prove to be more effective. Only be sure that your opening\nattitude is well thought out, and if it change as you warm up to\nyour subject, let not the change lay you open to a revulsion of\nfeeling in your audience.\nExample is a powerful means of suggestion. As we saw while\nthinking of environment in its effects on an audience, we do,\nwithout the usual amount of hesitation and criticism, what oth-\ners are doing. Paris wears certain hats and gowns; the rest of\nthe world imitates. The child mimics the actions, accents and\nintonations of the parent. Were a child never to hear anyone\nspeak, he would never acquire the power of speech, unless un-\nder most arduous training, and even then only imperfectly. One\nof the biggest department stores in the United States spends\nfortunes on one advertising slogan: \"Everybody is going to the\nbig store.\" That makes everybody want to go.\nYou can reinforce the power of your message by showing\nthat it has been widely accepted. Political organizations subsid-\nize applause to create the impression that their speakers' ideas\n229\nare warmly received and approved by the audience. The advoc-\nates of the commission-form of government of cities, the cham-\npions of votes for women, reserve as their strongest arguments\nthe fact that a number of cities and states have already suc-\ncessfully accepted their plans. Advertisements use the testimo-\nnial for its power of suggestion.\nObserve how this principle has been applied in the following\nselections, and utilize it on every occasion possible in your at-\ntempts to influence through suggestion:\nThe war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps\nfrom the North will bring to our ears the clash of re-\nsounding arms. Our brethren are already in the field.\nWhy stand ye here idle?\n\u2014Patrick Henry.\nWith a zeal approaching the zeal which inspired the Cru-\nsaders who followed Peter the Hermit, our silver Demo-\ncrats went forth from victory unto victory until they are\nnow assembled, not to discuss, not to debate, but to\nenter up the judgment already rendered by the plain\npeople of this country. In this contest brother has been\narrayed against brother, father against son. The\nwarmest ties of love, acquaintance, and association have\nbeen disregarded; old leaders have been cast aside when\nthey refused to give expression to the sentiments of\nthose whom they would lead, and new leaders have\nsprung up to give direction to this cause of truth. Thus\nhas the contest been waged, and we have assembled\nhere under as binding and solemn instructions as were\never imposed upon representatives of the people.\n\u2014William Jennings Bryan.\nFigurative and indirect language has suggestive force, be-\ncause it does not make statements that can be directly dis-\nputed. It arouses no contradictory ideas in the minds of the\naudience, thereby fulfilling one of the basic requisites of sug-\ngestion. By implying a conclusion in indirect or figurative lan-\nguage it is often asserted most forcefully.\n230\nNote that in the following Mr. Bryan did not say that Mr.\nMcKinley would be defeated. He implied it in a much more ef-\nfective manner:\nMr. McKinley was nominated at St. Louis upon a platform\nwhich declared for the maintenance of the gold standard until\nit can be changed into bimetallism by international agreement.\nMr. McKinley was the most popular man among the Republic-\nans, and three months ago everybody in the Republican party\nprophesied his election. How is it today? Why, the man who\nwas once pleased to think that he looked like Napoleon\u2014that\nman shudders today when he remembers that he was nomin-\nated on the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. Not only\nthat, but as he listens he can hear with ever-increasing dis-\ntinctness the sound of the waves as they beat upon the lonely\nshores of St. Helena.\nHad Thomas Carlyle said: \"A false man cannot found a reli-\ngion,\" his words would have been neither so suggestive nor so\npowerful, nor so long remembered as his implication in these\nstriking words:\nA false man found a religion? Why, a false man cannot build\na brick house! If he does not know and follow truly the proper-\nties of mortar, burnt clay, and what else he works in, it is no\nhouse that he makes, but a rubbish heap. It will not stand for\ntwelve centuries, to lodge a hundred and eighty millions; it\nwill fall straightway. A man must conform himself to Nature's\nlaws, be verily in communion with Nature and the truth of\nthings, or Nature will answer him, No, not at all!\nObserve how the picture that Webster draws here is much\nmore emphatic and forceful than any mere assertion could be:\nSir, I know not how others may feel, but as for myself when I\nlike Caesar in the senate\nsee my alma mater surrounded,\nhouse, by those who are reiterating stab after stab, I would not\nfor this right hand have her turn to me and say, \"And thou, too,\nmy son!\"\u2014Webster.\nA speech should be built on sound logical foundations, and\nno man should dare to speak in behalf of a fallacy. Arguing a\nsubject, however, will necessarily arouse contradictory ideas in\nthe mind of your audience. When immediate action or persua-\nthan\nsuggestion is more\nsion is desired,\nefficacious\n231\nargument\u2014when both are judiciously mixed, the effect is\nirresistible.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

In\nlogic26 is a fascinating subject, well worth the public\nfact,\nspeaker's study, for it explains the principles that govern the\nuse of argument and proof.\nArgumentation is the process of producing conviction by\nmeans of reasoning. Other ways of producing conviction there\nare, notably suggestion, as we have just shown, but no means\nis so high, so worthy of respect, as the adducing of sound reas-\nons in support of a contention.\nSince more than one side of a subject must be considered be-\nfore we can claim to have deliberated upon it fairly, we ought\nto think of argumentation under two aspects: building up an ar-\ngument, and tearing down an argument; that is, you must not\nonly examine into the stability of your structure of argument so\n26.McCosh's Logic is a helpful volume, and not too technical for the begin-\nner. A brief digest of logical principles as applied to public speaking is\ncontained in How to Attract and Hold an Audience, by J. Berg Esenwein.\n233\nthat it may both support the proposition you intend to probe\nand yet be so sound that it cannot be overthrown by oppon-\nents, but you must also be so keen to detect defects in argu-\nment that you will be able to demolish the weaker arguments\nof those who argue against you.\nWe can consider argumentation only generally,\nleaving\nminute and technical discussions to such excellent works as\nGeorge P. Baker's \"The Principles of Argumentation,\" and Ge-\norge Jacob Holyoake's \"Public Speaking and Debate.\" Any good\ncollege rhetoric also will give help on the subject, especially\nthe works of John Franklin Genung and Adams Sherman Hill.\nThe student is urged to familiarize himself with at least one of\nthese texts.\nThe following series of questions will, it is hoped, serve a\ntriple purpose: that of suggesting the forms of proof together\nwith the ways in which they may be used; that of helping the\nspeaker to test the strength of his arguments; and that of en-\nabling the speaker to attack his opponent's arguments with\nboth keenness and justice.\nTESTING AN ARGUMENT\nI. The Question Under Discussion\n1. Is it clearly stated?\n(a) Do the terms of statement mean the same to each dis-\nputant? (For example, the meaning of the term \"gentleman\"\nmay not be mutually agreed upon.)\n(b) Is confusion likely to arise as to its purpose?\n2. Is it fairly stated?\n(a) Does it include enough?\n(b) Does it include too much?\n(c) Is it stated so as to contain a trap?\n3. Is it a debatable question?\n4. What is the pivotal point in the whole question?\n5. What are the subordinate points?\nII. The Evidence\n1. The witnesses as to facts\n(a) Is each witness impartial? What is his relation to the sub-\nject at issue?\n(b) Is he mentally competent?\n234\n(c) Is he morally credible?\n(d) Is he in a position to know the facts? Is he an eye-\nwitness?\n(e) Is he a willing witness?\n(f) Is his testimony contradicted?\n(g) Is his testimony corroborated?\n(h) Is his testimony contrary to well-known facts or gener-\nal principles?\n(i) Is it probable?\n2. The authorities cited as evidence\n(a) Is the authority well-recognized as such?\n(b) What constitutes him an authority?\n(c) Is his interest in the case an impartial one?\n(d) Does he state his opinion positively and clearly?\n(e) Are the non-personal authorities cited (books, etc.) reli-\nable and unprejudiced?\n3. The facts adduced as evidence\n(a) Are they sufficient in number to constitute proof?\n(b) Are they weighty enough in character?\n(c) Are they in harmony with reason?\n(d) Are they mutually harmonious or contradictory?\n(e) Are they admitted, doubted, or disputed?\n4. The principles adduced as evidence\n(a) Are they axiomatic?\n(b) Are they truths of general experience?\n(c) Are they truths of special experience?\n(d) Are they truths arrived at by experiment? Were such ex-\nperiments special or general? Were the experiments authorit-\native and conclusive?\nIII. The Reasoning\n1. Inductions\n(a) Are the facts numerous enough to warrant accepting\nthe generalization as being conclusive?\n(b) Do the facts agree only when considered in the light of\nthis explanation as a conclusion?\n(c) Have you overlooked any contradictory facts?\n(d) Are the contradictory facts\nwhen this inference is accepted as true?\nsufficiently explained\n(e) Are\nall\nively untenable?\ncontrary positions\nshown to be\nrelat-\n235\n(f) Have you accepted mere opinions as facts?\n2. Deductions\n(a) Is the law or general principle a well-established one?\n(b) Does the law or principle clearly include the fact\nyou wish to deduce from it, or have you strained the inference?\n(c) Does the importance of the law or principle warrant\nso important an inference?\n(d) Can the deduction be shown to prove too much?\n3. Parallel cases\n(a) Are the cases parallel at enough points to warrant an in-\nference of similar cause or effect?\n(b) Are the cases parallel at the vital point at issue?\n(c) Has the parallelism been strained?\n(d) Are there no other parallels that would point\nto\na stronger contrary conclusion?\n4. Inferences\n(a) Are the antecedent conditions such as would make the al-\nlegation probable? (Character and opportunities of the ac-\ncused, for example.)\n(b) Are the signs that point to the inference either clear or\nnumerous enough to warrant its acceptance as fact?\n(c) Are the signs cumulative, and agreeable one with the\nother?\n(d) Could the signs be made to point\nto a contrary\nconclusion?\n5. Syllogisms\n(a) Have any steps been omitted in the syllogisms? (Such as\nin a syllogism in enthymeme.) If so, test any such by filling out\nthe syllogisms.\n(b) Have you been guilty of stating a conclusion that\nreally does not follow? (A non sequitur.)\n(c) Can your syllogism be reduced to an absurdity? (Reduc-\ntio ad absurdum.)\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Show why an unsupported assertion is not an argument.\n2. Illustrate how an irrelevant fact may be made to seem to\nsupport an argument.\n3. What inferences may justly be made from the following?\n236\nDuring the Boer War it was found that the average Eng-\nlishman did not measure up to the standards of recruit-\ning and the average soldier in the field manifested a low\nplane of vitality and endurance. Parliament, alarmed by\nthe disastrous consequences, instituted an investigation.\nThe commission appointed brought in a finding that alco-\nholic poisoning was the great cause of the national de-\ngeneracy. The investigations of the commission have\nbeen supplemented by investigations of scientific bodies\nand individual scientists, all arriving at the same conclu-\nsion. As a consequence, the British Government has\nplacarded the streets of a hundred cities with billboards\nsetting forth the destructive and degenerating nature of\nalcohol and appealing to the people in the name of the\nnation to desist from drinking alcoholic beverages.\nUnder efforts directed by the Government the British\nArmy is fast becoming an army of total abstainers.\nThe Governments of continental Europe followed the\nlead of the British Government. The French Government\nhas placarded France with appeals to the people, attrib-\nuting the decline of the birth rate and increase in the\ndeath rate to the widespread use of alcoholic beverages.\nThe experience of the German Government has been the\nsame. The German Emperor has clearly stated that lead-\nership in war and in peace will be held by the nation that\nroots out alcohol. He has undertaken to eliminate even\nthe drinking of beer, so far as possible, from the German\nArmy and Navy.\u2014Richmond Pearson Hobson, Before the\nU.S. Congress.\n4. Since the burden of proof lies on him who attacks a posi-\ntion, or argues for a change in affairs, how would his opponent\nbe likely to conduct his own part of a debate?\n5. Define (a) syllogism; (b) rebuttal; (c) \"begging the ques-\ntion;\" (d) premise; (e) rejoinder; (f) sur-rejoinder; (g) dilemma;\n(h) induction; (i) deduction; (j) a priori; (k) a posteriori; (l)\ninference.\n6. Criticise this reasoning:\n237\nMen ought not to smoke tobacco, because to do so is\ncontrary to best medical opinion. My physician has ex-\npressly condemned the practise, and is a medical author-\nity in this country.\n7. Criticise this reasoning:\nMen ought not to swear profanely, because it is wrong.\nIt is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral\nLaw, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is\ncontrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scrip-\ntures because it is contrary to the will of God, and we\nknow it is contrary to God's will because it is wrong.\n8. Criticise this syllogism:\nMAJOR PREMISE: All men who have no cares are happy.\nMINOR PREMISE: Slovenly men are careless.\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, slovenly men are happy.\n9. Criticise the following major, or foundation, premises:\nAll is not gold that glitters.\nAll cold may be expelled by fire.\n10. Criticise the following fallacy (non sequitur):\nMAJOR PREMISE: All strong men admire strength.\nMINOR PREMISE: This man is not strong.\nCONCLUSION: Therefore this man does not admire\nstrength.\n11. Criticise these statements:\nSleep is beneficial on account of its soporific qualities.\nFiske's histories are authentic because they contain ac-\ncurate accounts of American history, and we know that\nthey are true accounts for otherwise they would not be\ncontained in these authentic works.\n238\n12. What do you understand from the terms \"reasoning from\neffect to cause\" and \"from cause to effect?\" Give examples.\n13. What principle did Richmond Pearson Hobson employ in\nthe following?\nWhat is the police power of the States? The police power\nof the Federal Government or the State\u2014any sovereign\nState\u2014has been defined. Take the definition given by\nBlackstone, which is:\nThe due regulation and domestic order of the Kingdom,\nwhereby the inhabitants of a State, like members of a\nwell-governed family, are bound to conform their gener-\nal behavior to the rules of propriety, of neighborhood\nand good manners, and to be decent, industrious, and in-\noffensive in their respective stations.\nWould this amendment interfere with any State carrying\non the promotion of its domestic order?\nOr you can take the definition in another form, in which\nit is given by Mr. Tiedeman, when he says:\nThe object of government is to impose that degree of re-\nstraint upon human actions which is necessary to a uni-\nform, reasonable enjoyment of private rights. The power\nof the government to impose this restraint is called the\npolice power.\nJudge Cooley says of the liquor traffic:\nThe business of manufacturing and selling liquor is one\nthat affects the public interests in many ways and leads\nto many disorders. It has a tendency to increase pauper-\nism and crime. It renders a large force of peace officers\nessential, and it adds to the expense of the courts and of\nnearly all branches of civil administration.\nJustice Bradley, of the United States Supreme Court,\nsays:\nLicenses may be properly required in the pursuit of\nmany professions and avocations, which require peculiar\nskill and training or supervision for the public welfare.\nThe profession or avocation is open to all alike who will\nprepare themselves with the requisite qualifications or\ngive the requisite security for preserving public order.\nThis is in harmony with the general proposition that the\n239\nordinary pursuits of life, forming the greater per cent of\nthe industrial pursuits, are and ought to be free and\nopen to all, subject only to such general regulations, ap-\nplying equally to all, as the general good may demand.\nAll such regulations are entirely competent for the legis-\nlature to make and are in no sense an abridgment of the\nequal rights of citizens. But a license to do that which is\nodious and against common right is necessarily an out-\nrage upon the equal rights of citizens.\n14. What method did Jesus employ in the following:\nYe are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have lost his\nsavour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth\ngood for nothing but to be cast out, and to be trodden\nunder foot of men.\nBehold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do\nthey reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Fath-\ner feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\nAnd why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies\nof the field; how they grow; they toil not, neither do they\nspin; And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his\nglory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if\nGod so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and\ntomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more\nclothe you, O ye of little faith?\nOr what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread,\nwill he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give\nhim a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give\ngood gifts unto your children, how much more shall your\nFather which is in heaven give good things to them that\nask him?\n15. Make five original syllogisms27 on the following models:\nMajor Premise: He who administers arsenic gives pois-\non. Minor Premise: The prisoner administered arsenic to\nthe victim. Conclusion: Therefore the prisoner is a\npoisoner.\n240\nMajor Premise: All dogs are quadrupeds. Minor Premise:\nThis animal is a biped. Conclusion: Therefore this animal\nis not a dog.\n16. Prepare either the positive or the negative side of the fol-\nlowing question for debate: The recall of judges should be ad-\nopted as a national principle.\n17. Is this question debatable? Benedict Arnold was a gentle-\nman. Give reasons for your answer.\n18. Criticise any street or dinner-table argument you have\nheard recently.\n19. Test the reasoning of any of the speeches given in this\nvolume.\n20. Make a short speech arguing in favor of instruction in\npublic speaking in the public evening schools.\n21. (a) Clip a newspaper editorial in which the reasoning is\nweak. (b) Criticise it. (c) Correct it.\n22. Make a list of three subjects for debate, selected from the\nmonthly magazines.\n23. Do the same from the newspapers.\n24. Choosing your own question and side, prepare a brief\nsuitable for a ten-minute debating argument. The following\nmodels of briefs may help you:\nDEBATE\nResolved: That armed intervention is not justifiable on the\npart of any nation to collect, on behalf of private individuals,\nfinancial claims against any American nation.28\n27.For those who would make a further study of the syllogism the follow-\ning rules are given: 1. In a syllogism there should be only three terms. 2.\nOf these three only one can be the middle term. 3. One premise must be\naffirmative. 4. The conclusion must be negative if either premise is negat-\nive. 5. To prove a negative, one of the premises must be negative. Sum-\nmary of Regulating Principles: 1. Terms which agree with the same thing\nagree with each other; and when only one of two terms agrees with a\nthird term, the two terms disagree with each other. 2. \"Whatever is af-\nfirmed of a class may be affirmed of all the members of that class,\" and\n\"Whatever is denied of a class may be denied of all the members of that\nclass.\"\n28.All the speakers were from Brown University. The affirmative briefs\nwere used in debate with the Dartmouth College team, and the negative\nbriefs were used in debate with the Williams College team. From The\nSpeaker, by permission.\n241\nBrief of Affirmative Argument\nFirst speaker\u2014Chafee\nArmed intervention for collection of private claims from\nany American nation is not justifiable, for\n1. It is wrong in principle, because\n(a) It violates the fundamental principles of international\nlaw for a very slight cause\n(b) It is contrary to the proper function of the State, and\n(c) It is contrary to justice, since claims are exaggerated.\nSecond speaker\u2014Hurley\n2. It is disastrous in its results, because\n(a) It incurs danger of grave international complications\n(b) It tends to increase the burden of debt in the South\nAmerican republics\n(c) It encourages a waste of the world's capital, and\n(d) It disturbs peace and stability in South America.\nThird speaker\u2014Bruce\n3. It is unnecessary to collect in this way, because\n(a) Peaceful methods have succeeded\n(b) If these should fail, claims should be settled by The\nHague Tribunal\n(c) The fault has always been with European States when\nforce has been used, and\n(d) In any case, force should not be used, for it counter-\nacts the movement towards peace.\nBrief of Negative Argument\nFirst speaker\u2014Branch\nArmed intervention for the collection of private financial\nclaims against some American States is justifiable, for\n1. When other means of collection have failed, armed in-\ntervention against any nation is essentially proper,\nbecause\n(a) Justice should always be secured\n242\n(b) Non-enforcement of payment puts a premium on\ndishonesty\n(c) Intervention for this purpose is sanctioned by the\nbest international authority\n(d) Danger of undue collection is slight and can be\navoided entirely by submission of claims to The Hague\nTribunal before intervening.\nSecond speaker\u2014Stone\n2. Armed intervention is necessary to secure justice in\ntropical America, for\n(a) The governments of this section constantly repudiate\njust debts\n(b) They insist that the final decision about claims shall\nrest with their own corrupt courts\n(c) They refuse to arbitrate sometimes.\nThird speaker\u2014Dennett\n3. Armed intervention is beneficial in its results, because\n(a) It inspires responsibility\n(b) In administering custom houses it removes tempta-\ntion to revolutions\n(c) It gives confidence to desirable capital.\nAmong others, the following books were used in the prepara-\ntion of the arguments:\nN. \"The Monroe Doctrine,\" by T.B. Edgington. Chapters\n22-28.\n\"Digest of International Law,\" by J.B. Moore. Report of\nPenfield of proceedings before Hague Tribunal in 1903.\n\"Statesman's Year Book\" (for statistics).\nA. Minister Drago's appeal to the United States, in For-\neign Relations of United States, 1903.\nPresident Roosevelt's Message, 1905, pp. 33-37.\nAnd articles in the following magazines (among many\nothers):\n243\n\"Journal of Political Economy,\" December, 1906.\n\"Atlantic Monthly,\" October, 1906.\n\"North American Review,\" Vol. 183, p. 602.\nAll of these contain material valuable for both sides, except\nthose marked \"N\" and \"A,\" which are useful only for the negat-\nive and affirmative, respectively.\nNote:\u2014Practise in debating is most helpful to the public\nspeaker, but if possible each debate should be under the super-\nvision of some person whose word will be respected, so that\nthe debaters might show regard for courtesy, accuracy, effect-\nive reasoning, and the necessity for careful preparation. The\nAppendix contains a list of questions for debate.\n25. Are the following points well considered?\nThe Inheritance Tax is Not a Good Social Reform\nMeasure\nA. Does not strike at the root of the evil\n1. Fortunes not a menace in themselves A fortune\nof $500,000 may be a greater social evil than one of\n$500,000,000\n2. Danger of wealth depends on its wrong accumu-\nlation and use\n3. Inheritance tax will not prevent rebates, mono-\npoly, discrimination, bribery, etc.\n4. Laws aimed at unjust accumulation and use of\nwealth furnish the true remedy.\nB. It would be evaded\n1. Low rates are evaded\n2. Rate must be high to result in distribution of\ngreat fortunes.\n26.

It is an attempt to influence\nby means of appeal to some particular interest held important\nby the hearer. Its motive may be high or low, fair or unfair,\nhonest or dishonest, calm or passionate, and hence its scope is\nunparalleled in public speaking.\nThis \"instilment of conviction,\" to use Matthew Arnold's ex-\npression, is naturally a complex process in that it usually in-\ncludes argumentation and often employs suggestion, as the\nnext chapter will illustrate. In fact, there is little public speak-\ning worthy of the name that is not in some part persuasive, for\nmen rarely speak solely to alter men's opinions\u2014the ulterior\npurpose is almost always action.\nThe nature of persuasion is not solely intellectual, but is\nlargely emotional. It uses every principle of public speaking,\n245\nand every \"form of discourse,\" to use a rhetorician's expres-\nsion, but argument supplemented by special appeal is its pecu-\nliar quality. This we may best see by examining\nThe Methods of Persuasion\nHigh-minded speakers often seek to move their hearers to\naction by an appeal to their highest motives, such as love of\nliberty. Senator Hoar, in pleading for action on the Philippine\nquestion, used this method:\nWhat has been the practical statesmanship which comes\nfrom your ideals and your sentimentalities? You have\nwasted nearly six hundred millions of treasure. You have\nsacrificed nearly ten thousand American lives\u2014the\nflower of our youth. You have devastated provinces. You\nhave slain uncounted thousands of the people you desire\nto benefit. You have established reconcentration camps.\nYour generals are coming home from their harvest bring-\ning sheaves with them, in the shape of other thousands\nof sick and wounded and insane to drag out miserable\nlives, wrecked in body and mind. You make the American\nflag in the eyes of a numerous people the emblem of sac-\nrilege in Christian churches, and of the burning of hu-\nman dwellings, and of the horror of the water torture.\nYour practical statesmanship which disdains to take Ge-\norge Washington and Abraham Lincoln or the soldiers of\nthe Revolution or of the Civil War as models, has looked\nin some cases to Spain for your example. I believe\u2014nay,\nI know\u2014that in general our officers and soldiers are hu-\nmane. But in some cases they have carried on your war-\nfare with a mixture of American ingenuity and Castilian\ncruelty.\nYour practical statesmanship has succeeded in convert-\ning a people who three years ago were ready to kiss the\nhem of the garment of the American and to welcome him\nas a liberator, who thronged after your men, when they\nlanded on those islands, with benediction and gratitude,\ninto sullen and irreconcilable enemies, possessed of a\nhatred which centuries cannot eradicate.\nMr. President, this is the eternal law of human nature.\nYou may struggle against it, you may try to escape it,\n246\nyou may persuade yourself that your intentions are bene-\nvolent, that your yoke will be easy and your burden will\nbe light, but it will assert itself again. Government\nwithout the consent of the governed\u2014authority which\nheaven never gave\u2014can only be supported by means\nwhich heaven never can sanction.\nThe American people have got this one question to an-\nswer. They may answer it now; they can take ten years,\nor twenty years, or a generation, or a century to think of\nit. But will not down. They must answer it in the end:\nCan you lawfully buy with money, or get by brute force\nof arms, the right to hold in subjugation an unwilling\npeople, and to impose on them such constitution as you,\nand not they, think best for them?\nSenator Hoar then went on to make another sort of ap-\npeal\u2014the appeal to fact and experience:\nWe have answered this question a good many times in\nthe past. The fathers answered it in 1776, and founded\nthe Republic upon their answer, which has been the\ncorner-stone. John Quincy Adams and James Monroe\nanswered it again in the Monroe Doctrine, which John\nQuincy Adams declared was only the doctrine of the con-\nsent of the governed. The Republican party answered it\nwhen it took possession of the force of government at\nthe beginning of the most brilliant period in all legislat-\nive history. Abraham Lincoln answered it when, on that\nfatal journey to Washington in 1861, he announced that\nas the doctrine of his political creed, and declared, with\nprophetic vision, that he was ready to be assassinated\nfor it if need be. You answered it again yourselves when\nyou said that Cuba, who had no more title than the\npeople of the Philippine Islands had to their independ-\nence, of right ought to be free and independent.\n\u2014George F. Hoar.\nAppeal to the things that man holds dear is another potent\nform of persuasion.\nJoseph Story, in his great Salem speech (1828) used this\nmethod most dramatically:\n247\nI call upon you, fathers, by the shades of your ancest-\nors\u2014by the dear ashes which repose in this precious\nsoil\u2014by all you are, and all you hope to be\u2014resist every\nobject of disunion, resist every encroachment upon your\nliberties, resist every attempt to fetter your consciences,\nor smother your public schools, or extinguish your sys-\ntem of public instruction.\nI call upon you, mothers, by that which never fails in wo-\nman, the love of your offspring; teach them, as they\nclimb your knees, or lean on your bosoms, the blessings\nof liberty. Swear them at the altar, as with their baptis-\nmal vows, to be true to their country, and never to forget\nor forsake her.\nI call upon you, young men, to remember whose sons\nyou are; whose inheritance you possess. Life can never\nbe too short, which brings nothing but disgrace and op-\npression. Death never comes too soon, if necessary in de-\nfence of the liberties of your country.\nI call upon you, old men, for your counsels, and your\nprayers, and your benedictions. May not your gray hairs\ngo down in sorrow to the grave, with the recollection\nthat you have lived in vain. May not your last sun sink in\nthe west upon a nation of slaves.\nNo; I read in the destiny of my country far better hopes,\nfar brighter visions. We, who are now assembled here,\nmust soon be gathered to the congregation of other\ndays. The time of our departure is at hand, to make way\nfor our children upon the theatre of life. May God speed\nthem and theirs. May he who, at the distance of another\ncentury, shall stand here to celebrate this day, still look\nround upon a free, happy, and virtuous people. May he\nhave reason to exult as we do. May he, with all the en-\nthusiasm of truth as well as of poetry, exclaim, that here\nis still his country.\u2014Joseph Story.\nThe appeal to prejudice is effective\u2014though not often, if\never, justifiable; yet so long as special pleading endures this\nsort of persuasion will be resorted to. Rudyard Kipling uses\nthis method\u2014as have many others on both sides\u2014in discussing\nthe great European war. Mingled with the appeal to prejudice,\n248\nMr. Kipling uses the appeal to self-interest; though not the\nhighest, it is a powerful motive in all our lives. Notice how at\nthe last the pleader sweeps on to the highest ground he can\ntake. This is a notable example of progressive appeal, begin-\nning with a low motive and ending with a high one in such a\nway as to carry all the force of prejudice yet gain all the value\nof patriotic fervor.\nThrough no fault nor wish of ours we are at war with\nGermany, the power which owes its existence to three\nwell-thought-out wars; the power which, for the last\ntwenty years, has devoted itself to organizing and pre-\nparing for this war; the power which is now fighting to\nconquer the civilized world.\nFor the last two generations the Germans in their books,\nlectures, speeches and schools have been carefully\ntaught that nothing less than this world-conquest was\nthe object of their preparations and their sacrifices. They\nhave prepared carefully and sacrificed greatly.\nWe must have men and men and men, if we, with our al-\nlies, are to check the onrush of organized barbarism.\nHave no illusions. We are dealing with a strong and mag-\nnificently equipped enemy, whose avowed aim is our\ncomplete destruction. The violation of Belgium, the at-\ntack on France and the defense against Russia, are only\nsteps by the way. The German's real objective, as she al-\nways has told us, is England, and England's wealth,\ntrade and worldwide possessions.\nIf you assume, for an instant, that the attack will be suc-\ncessful, England will not be reduced, as some people\nsay, to the rank of a second rate power, but we shall\ncease to exist as a nation. We shall become an outlying\nprovince of Germany, to be administered with that sever-\nity German safety and interest require.\nWe are against such a fate. We enter into a new life in\nwhich all the facts of war that we had put behind or for-\ngotten for the last hundred years, have returned to the\nfront and test us as they tested our fathers. It will be a\nlong and a hard road, beset with difficulties and\n249\ndiscouragements, but we tread it together and we will\ntread it together to the end.\nOur petty social divisions and barriers have been swept\naway at the outset of our mighty struggle. All the in-\nterests of our life of six weeks ago are dead. We have but\none interest now, and that touches the naked heart of\nevery man in this island and in the empire.\nIf we are to win the right for ourselves and for freedom\nto exist on earth, every man must offer himself for that\nservice and that sacrifice.\nFrom these examples it will be seen that the particular way\nin which the speakers appealed to their hearers was by coming\nclose home to their interests, and by themselves showing emo-\ntion\u2014two very important principles which you must keep con-\nstantly in mind.\nTo accomplish the former requires a deep knowledge of hu-\nman motive in general and an understanding of the particular\naudience addressed. What are the motives that arouse men to\naction? Think of them earnestly, set them down on the tablets\nof your mind, study how to appeal to them worthily. Then, what\nmotives would be likely to appeal to your hearers? What are\ntheir ideals and interests in life? A mistake in your estimate\nmay cost you your case. To appeal to pride in appearance\nwould make one set of men merely laugh\u2014to try to arouse sym-\npathy for the Jews in Palestine would be wasted effort among\nothers. Study your audience, feel your way, and when you have\nonce raised a spark, fan it into a flame by every honest re-\nsource you possess.\nThe larger your audience the more sure you are to find a uni-\nversal basis of appeal. A small audience of bachelors will not\ngrow excited over the importance of furniture insurance; most\nmen can be roused to the defense of the freedom of the press.\nPatent medicine advertisement usually begins by talking\nabout your pains\u2014they begin on your interests. If they first dis-\ncussed the size and rating of their establishment, or the effic-\nacy of their remedy, you would never read the \"ad.\" If they can\nmake you think you have nervous troubles you will even plead\nfor a remedy\u2014they will not have to try to sell it.\n250\nThe patent medicine men are pleading\u2014asking you to invest\nyour money in their commodity\u2014yet they do not appear to be\ndoing so. They get over on your side of the fence, and arouse a\ndesire for their nostrums by appealing to your own interests.\nRecently a book-salesman entered an attorney's office in\nNew York and inquired: \"Do you want to buy a book?\" Had the\nlawyer wanted a book he would probably have bought one\nwithout waiting for a book-salesman to call. The solicitor made\nthe same mistake as the representative who made his approach\nwith: \"I want to sell you a sewing machine.\" They both talked\nonly in terms of their own interests.\nThe successful pleader must convert his arguments into\nterms of his hearers' advantage. Mankind are still selfish, are\ninterested in what will serve them. Expunge from your address\nyour own personal concern and present your appeal in terms of\nthe general good, and to do this you need not be insincere, for\nyou had better not plead any cause that is not for the hearers'\ngood. Notice how Senator Thurston in his plea for intervention\nin Cuba and Mr. Bryan in his \"Cross of Gold\" speech consti-\ntuted themselves the apostles of humanity.\nExhortation is a highly impassioned form of appeal\nfre-\nquently used by the pulpit in efforts to arouse men to a sense\nof duty and induce them to decide their personal courses, and\nby counsel in seeking to influence a jury. The great preachers,\nlike the great jury-lawyers, have always been masters of\npersuasion.\nNotice the difference among these four exhortations, and\nanalyze the motives appealed to:\nRevenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a\ntraitor live!\u2014Shakespeare, Julius C\u00e6sar.\nStrike\u2014till the last armed foe expires,\nStrike\u2014for your altars and your fires,\nStrike\u2014for the green graves of your sires,\nGod\u2014and your native land!\n\u2014Fitz-Greene Halleck, Marco Bozzaris.\nBelieve, gentlemen, if it were not for those children, he\nwould not come here to-day to seek such remuneration;\nif it were not that, by your verdict, you may prevent\nthose little innocent defrauded wretches from becoming\n251\nwandering beggars, as well as orphans on the face of\nthis earth. Oh, I know I need not ask this verdict from\nyour mercy; I need not extort it from your compassion; I\nwill receive it from your justice. I do conjure you, not as\nfathers, but as husbands:\u2014not as husbands, but as cit-\nizens:\u2014not as citizens, but as men:\u2014not as men, but\nas Christians:\u2014by all your obligations, public, private,\nmoral, and religious; by the hearth profaned; by the\nhome desolated; by the canons of the living God foully\nspurned;\u2014save, oh: save your firesides from the conta-\ngion, your country from the crime, and perhaps thou-\nsands, yet unborn, from the shame, and sin, and sorrow\nof this example!\n\u2014Charles Phillips, Appeal to the jury in behalf of\nGuthrie.\nSo I appeal from the men in silken hose who danced to\nmusic made by slaves and called it freedom, from the\nmen in bell-crown hats who led Hester Prynne to her\nshame and called it religion, to that Americanism which\nreaches forth its arms to smite wrong with reason and\ntruth, secure in the power of both. I appeal from the pat-\nriarchs of New England to the poets of New England;\nfrom Endicott to Lowell; from Winthrop to Longfellow;\nfrom Norton to Holmes; and I appeal in the name and by\nthe rights of that common citizenship\u2014of that common\norigin, back of both the Puritan and the Cavalier, to\nwhich all of us owe our being. Let the dead past, consec-\nrated by the blood of its martyrs, not by its savage\nhatreds, darkened alike by kingcraft and priestcraft\u2014let\nthe dead past bury its dead. Let the present and the fu-\nture ring with the song of the singers. Blessed be the les-\nsons they teach, the laws they make. Blessed be the eye\nto see, the light to reveal. Blessed be tolerance, sitting\never on the right hand of God to guide the way with lov-\ning word, as blessed be all that brings us nearer the goal\nof true religion, true republicanism, and true patriotism,\ndistrust of watchwords and labels, shams and heroes, be-\nlief in our country and ourselves. It was not Cotton\nMather, but John Greenleaf Whittier, who cried:\n252\nDear God and Father of us all,\nForgive our faith in cruel lies,\nForgive the blindness that denies.\nCast down our idols\u2014overturn\nOur Bloody altars\u2014make us see\nThyself in Thy humanity!\n\u2014Henry Watterson, Puritan and Cavalier.\nGoethe, on being reproached for not having written war\nsongs against the French, replied, \"In my poetry I have never\nshammed. How could I have written songs of hate without\nhatred?\" Neither is it possible to plead with full efficiency for a\ncause for which you do not feel deeply. Feeling is contagious as\nbelief is contagious. The speaker who pleads with real feeling\nfor his own convictions will instill his feelings into his listeners.\nSincerity, force, enthusiasm, and above all, feeling\u2014these are\nthe qualities that move multitudes and make appeals irresist-\nible. They are of far greater importance than technical prin-\nciples of delivery, grace of gesture, or polished enunci-\nation\u2014important as all these elements must doubtless be con-\nsidered. Base your appeal on reason, but do not end in the\nbasement\u2014let the building rise, full of deep emotion and noble\npersuasion.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. (a) What elements of appeal do you find in the following?\n(b) Is it too florid? (c) Is this style equally powerful today? (d)\nAre the sentences too long and involved for clearness and\nforce?\nOh, gentlemen, am I this day only the counsel of my cli-\nent? No, no; I am the advocate of humanity\u2014of\nyourselves\u2014your homes\u2014your wives\u2014your famil-\nies\u2014your little children. I am glad that this case exhibits\nsuch atrocity; unmarked as it is by any mitigatory fea-\nture, it may stop the frightful advance of this calamity; it\nwill be met now, and marked with vengeance. If it be\nnot, farewell to the virtues of your country; farewell to\n253\nall confidence between man and man; farewell to that\nunsuspicious and reciprocal tenderness, without which\nmarriage is but a consecrated curse. If oaths are to be\nviolated, laws disregarded, friendship betrayed, human-\nity trampled, national and individual honor stained, and\nif a jury of fathers and of husbands will give such\nmiscreancy a passport to their homes, and wives, and\ndaughters,\u2014farewell to all that yet remains of Ireland!\nBut I will not cast such a doubt upon the character of my\ncountry. Against the sneer of the foe, and the skepticism\nof the foreigner, I will still point to the domestic virtues,\nthat no perfidy could barter, and no bribery can pur-\nchase, that with a Roman usage, at once embellish and\nconsecrate households, giving to the society of the\nhearth all the purity of the altar; that lingering alike in\nthe palace and the cottage, are still to be found\nscattered over this land\u2014the relic of what she was\u2014the\nsource perhaps of what she may be\u2014the lone, the\nstately, and magnificent memorials, that rearing their\nmajesty amid surrounding ruins, serve at once as the\nlandmarks of the departed glory, and the models by\nwhich the future may be erected.\nPreserve those virtues with a vestal fidelity; mark this\nday, by your verdict, your horror of their profanation;\nand believe me, when the hand which records that ver-\ndict shall be dust, and the tongue that asks it, traceless\nin the grave, many a happy home will bless its con-\nsequences, and many a mother teach her little child to\nhate the impious treason of adultery.\n\u2014Charles Phillips.\n2.

The reason that\npreachers in this present generation are less successful\nin getting people to want goodness than business men\nare in getting them to want motorcars, hats, and piano-\nlas, is that business men as a class are more close and\ndesperate students of human nature, and have boned\ndown harder to the art of touching the imaginations of\nthe crowds.\u2014Gerald Stanley Lee, Crowds.\nIn the early part of July, 1914, a collection of Frenchmen in\nParis, or Germans in Berlin, was not a crowd in a psychological\nsense. Each individual had his own special interests and needs,\nand there was no powerful common idea to unify them. A\ngroup then represented only a collection of individuals. A\nmonth later, any collection of Frenchmen or Germans formed a\ncrowd: Patriotism, hate, a common fear, a pervasive grief, had\nunified the individuals.\nThe psychology of the crowd is far different from the psycho-\nlogy of the personal members that compose it. The crowd is a\ndistinct entity. Individuals restrain and subdue many of their\nimpulses at the dictates of reason. The crowd never reasons. It\nonly feels. As persons there is a sense of responsibility at-\ntached to our actions which checks many of our incitements,\nbut the sense of responsibility is lost in the crowd because of\nits numbers. The crowd is exceedingly suggestible and will act\nupon the wildest and most extreme ideas. The crowd-mind is\nprimitive and will cheer plans and perform actions which its\nmembers would utterly repudiate.\nA mob is only a highly-wrought crowd. Ruskin's description is\nfitting: \"You can talk a mob into anything; its feelings may\n257\nbe\u2014usually are\u2014on the whole, generous and right, but it has\nno foundation for them, no hold of them. You may tease or\ntickle it into anything at your pleasure. It thinks by infection,\nfor the most part, catching an opinion like a cold, and there is\nnothing so little that it will not roar itself wild about, when the\nfit is on, nothing so great but it will forget in an hour when the\nfit is past.\"29\nHistory will show us how the crowd-mind works. The mediev-\nal mind was not given to reasoning; the medieval man attached\ngreat weight to the utterance of authority; his religion touched\nchiefly the emotions. These conditions provided a rich soil for\nthe propagation of the crowd-mind when, in the eleventh cen-\ntury, flagellation, a voluntary self-scourging, was preached by\nthe monks. Substituting flagellation for reciting penitential\npsalms was advocated by the reformers. A scale was drawn up,\nmaking one thousand strokes equivalent to ten psalms, or fif-\nteen thousand to the entire psalter. This craze spread by\nleaps\u2014and crowds. Flagellant fraternities sprang up. Priests\ncarrying banners led through the streets great processions re-\nciting prayers and whipping their bloody bodies with leathern\nthongs fitted with four iron points. Pope Clement denounced\nthis practise and several of the leaders of these processions\nhad to be burned at the stake before the frenzy could be\nuprooted.\nAll western and central Europe was turned into a crowd by\nthe preaching of the crusaders, and millions of the followers of\nthe Prince of Peace rushed to the Holy Land to kill the hea-\nthen. Even the children started on a crusade against the Sara-\ncens. The mob-spirit was so strong that home affections and\npersuasion could not prevail against it and thousands of mere\nbabes died in their attempts to reach and redeem the Sacred\nSepulchre.\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century the South Sea\nCompany was formed in England. Britain became a speculative\ncrowd. Stock in the South Sea Company rose from 128-1/2\npoints in January to 550 in May, and scored 1,000 in July. Five\nmillion shares were sold at this premium. Speculation ran riot.\nHundreds of companies were organized. One was formed \"for a\nwheel of perpetual motion.\" Another never troubled to give any\n29.Sesame and Lilies.\n258\nreason at all for taking the cash of its subscribers\u2014it merely\nannounced that it was organized \"for a design which will here-\nafter be promulgated.\" Owners began to sell, the mob caught\nthe suggestion, a panic ensued, the South Sea Company stock\nfell 800 points in a few days, and more than a billion dollars\nevaporated in this era of frenzied speculation.\nThe burning of the witches at Salem, the Klondike gold\ncraze, and the forty-eight people who were killed by mobs in\nthe United States in 1913, are examples familiar to us in\nAmerica.\nThe Crowd Must Have a Leader\nThe leader of the crowd or mob is its determining factor. He\nbecomes self-hynoptized with the idea that unifies its mem-\nbers, his enthusiasm is contagious\u2014and so is theirs. The crowd\nacts as he suggests. The great mass of people do not have any\nvery sharply-drawn conclusions on any subject outside of their\nown little spheres, but when they become a crowd they are\nperfectly willing to accept ready-made, hand-me-down opin-\nions. They will follow a leader at all costs\u2014in labor troubles\nthey often follow a leader in preference to obeying their gov-\nernment, in war they will throw self-preservation to the bushes\nand follow a leader in the face of guns that fire fourteen times\na second. The mob becomes shorn of will-power and blindly\nobedient to its dictator. The Russian Government, recognizing\nthe menace of the crowd-mind to its autocracy, formerly pro-\nhibited public gatherings. History is full of similar instances.\nHow the Crowd is Created\nToday the crowd is as real a factor in our socialized life as\nare magnates and monopolies. It is too complex a problem\nmerely to damn or praise it\u2014it must be reckoned with, and\nmastered. The present problem is how to get the most and the\nbest out of the crowd-spirit, and the public speaker finds this to\nbe peculiarly his own question. His influence is multiplied if he\ncan only transmute his audience into a crowd. His affirmations\nmust be their conclusions.\nThis can be accomplished by unifying the minds and needs of\nthe audience and arousing their emotions. Their feelings, not\ntheir reason, must be played upon\u2014it is \"up to\" him to do this\nnobly. Argument has its place on the platform, but even its\n259\npotencies must subserve the speaker's plan of attack to win\npossession of his audience.\nReread the chapter on \"Feeling and Enthusiasm.\" It is im-\npossible to make an audience a crowd without appealing to\ntheir emotions. Can you imagine the average group becoming a\ncrowd while hearing a lecture on Dry Fly Fishing, or on Egyp-\ntian Art? On the other hand, it would not have required world-\nfamous eloquence to have turned any audience in Ulster, in\n1914,\ninto a crowd by discussing the Home Rule Act. The\ncrowd-spirit depends largely on the subject used to fuse their\nindividualities into one glowing whole.\nNote how Antony played upon the feelings of his hearers in\nthe famous funeral oration given by Shakespeare in \"Julius\nC\u00e6sar.\" From murmuring units the men became a unit\u2014a mob.\nANTONY'S ORATION OVER C\u00c6SAR'S BODY\nFriends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears;\nI come to bury C\u00e6sar, not to praise him.\nThe evil that men do lives after them;\nThe good is oft interred with their bones:\nSo let it be with C\u00e6sar! The Noble Brutus\nHath told you C\u00e6sar was ambitious.\nIf it were so, it was a grievous fault,\nAnd grievously hath C\u00e6sar answered it.\nHere, under leave of Brutus, and the rest\u2014\nFor Brutus is an honorable man,\nSo are they all, all honorable men\u2014\nCome I to speak in C\u00e6sar's funeral.\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me:\nBut Brutus says he was ambitious;\nAnd Brutus is an honorable man.\nHe hath brought many captives home to Rome,\nWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\nDid this in C\u00e6sar seem ambitious?\nWhen that the poor have cried, C\u00e6sar hath wept;\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuff:\nYet Brutus says, he was ambitious;\nAnd Brutus is an honorable man.\nYou all did see, that, on the Lupercal,\n260\nI thrice presented him a kingly crown,\nWhich he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\nAnd sure, he is an honorable man.\nI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\nBut here I am to speak what I do know.\nYou all did love him once, not without cause;\nWhat cause withholds you then to mourn for him?\nOh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,\nAnd men have lost their reason!\u2014Bear with me;\nMy heart is in the coffin there with C\u00e6sar,\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.\n1 Plebeian. Methinks there is much reason in his\nsayings.\n2 Ple. If thou consider rightly of the matter,\nC\u00e6sar has had great wrong.\n3 Ple. Has he, masters?\nI fear there will a worse come in his place.\n4 Ple. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the\ncrown;\nTherefore, 'tis certain, he was not ambitious.\n1 Ple. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.\n2 Ple. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.\n3 Ple. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\n4 Ple. Now mark him, he begins again to speak.\nAnt. But yesterday, the word of C\u00e6sar might\nHave stood against the world: now lies he there,\nAnd none so poor to do him reverence.\nOh, masters! if I were dispos'd to stir\nYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\n261\nI should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,\nWho, you all know, are honorable men.\nI will not do them wrong; I rather choose\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,\nThan I will wrong such honorable men.\nBut here's a parchment, with the seal of C\u00e6sar;\nI found it in his closet; 'tis his will:\nLet but the commons hear this testament\u2014\nWhich, pardon me, I do not mean to read\u2014\nAnd they would go and kiss dead C\u00e6sar's wounds,\nAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood;\nYea, beg a hair of him for memory,\nAnd, dying, mention it within their wills,\nBequeathing it as a rich legacy\nUnto their issue.\n4 Ple. We'll hear the will: Read it, Mark Antony.\nAll. The will! the will! we will hear C\u00e6sar's will.\nAnt. Have patience, gentle friends: I must not read it;\nIt is not meet you know how C\u00e6sar lov'd you.\nYou are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\nAnd, being men, hearing the will of C\u00e6sar,\nIt will inflame you, it will make you mad:\n'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;\nFor if you should, oh, what would come of it!\n4 Ple. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony!\nYou shall read us the will! C\u00e6sar's will!\nAnt. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\nI have o'ershot myself, to tell you of it.\nI fear I wrong the honorable men\nWhose daggers have stab'd C\u00e6sar; I do fear it.\n4 Ple. They were traitors: Honorable men!\nAll. The will! the testament!\n262\n2 Ple. They were villains, murtherers! The will! Read the\nwill!\nAnt. You will compel me then to read the will?\nThen, make a ring about the corpse of C\u00e6sar,\nAnd let me shew you him that made the will.\nShall I descend? And will you give me leave?\nAll. Come down.\n2 Ple. Descend. [He comes down from the Rostrum.\n3 Ple. You shall have leave.\n4 Ple. A ring; stand round.\n1 Ple. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.\n2 Ple. Room for Antony!\u2014most noble Antony!\nAnt. Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.\nAll. Stand back! room! bear back!\nAnt. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now;\nYou all do know this mantle: I remember\nThe first time ever C\u00e6sar put it on;\n'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,\nThat day he overcame the Nervii.\nLook, in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through:\nSee, what a rent the envious Casca made:\nThrough this, the well-beloved Brutus stab'd;\nAnd as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,\nMark how the blood of C\u00e6sar follow'd it!\u2014\nAs rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd\nIf Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;\nFor Brutus, as you know, was C\u00e6sar's angel:\nJudge, O you Gods, how C\u00e6sar lov'd him!\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all!\nFor when the noble C\u00e6sar saw him stab,\n263\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,\nQuite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;\nAnd in his mantle muffling up his face,\nEven at the base of Pompey's statue,\nWhich all the while ran blood, great C\u00e6sar fell.\nOh what a fall was there, my countrymen!\nThen I and you, and all of us, fell down,\nWhilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.\nOh! now you weep; and I perceive you feel\nThe dint of pity; these are gracious drops.\nKind souls! what, weep you, when you but behold\nOur C\u00e6sar's vesture wounded? Look you here!\nHere is himself, mar'd, as you see, by traitors.\n1 Ple. Oh, piteous spectacle!\n2 Ple. Oh, noble C\u00e6sar!\n3 Ple. Oh, woful day!\n4 Ple. Oh, traitors, villains!\n1 Ple.

Hear the noble Antony.\n2 Ple. We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.\nAnt. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\nTo such a sudden flood of mutiny:\nThey that have done this deed are honorable:\nWhat private griefs they have, alas! I know not,\nThat made them do it; they are wise, and honorable,\n264\nAnd will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\nI come not, friends, to steal away your hearts;\nI am no orator, as Brutus is;\nBut as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\nThat love my friend, and that they know full well\nThat gave me public leave to speak of him:\nFor I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\nAction, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\nTo stir men's blood. I only speak right on:\nI tell you that which you yourselves do know;\nShow your sweet C\u00e6sar's wounds, poor, poor, dumb\nmouths,\nAnd bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,\nAnd Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\nWould ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue\nIn every wound of C\u00e6sar, that should move\nThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\nAll. We'll mutiny!\n1 Ple. We'll burn the house of Brutus.\n3 Ple. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.\nAnt. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\nAll. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony.\nAnt. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.\nWherein hath C\u00e6sar thus deserv'd your loves?\nAlas! you know not!\u2014I must tell you then.\nYou have forgot the will I told you of.\nPle. Most true;\u2014the will!\u2014let's stay, and hear the will.\nAnt. Here is the will, and under C\u00e6sar's seal.\nTo every Roman citizen he gives,\nTo every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\n2 Ple. Most noble C\u00e6sar!\u2014we'll revenge his death.\n265\n3 Ple. O royal C\u00e6sar! Ant. Hear me with patience.\nAll. Peace, ho!\nAnt. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,\nHis private arbours, and new-planted orchards,\nOn this side Tiber; he hath left them you,\nAnd to your heirs forever, common pleasures,\nTo walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.\nHere was a C\u00e6sar! When comes such another?\n1 Ple. Never, never!\u2014Come, away, away!\nWe'll burn his body in the holy place,\nAnd with the brands fire the traitors' houses.\nTake up the body.\n2 Ple. Go, fetch fire.\n3 Ple. Pluck down benches.\n4 Ple. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.\n[Exeunt Citizens, with the body.\nAnt. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,\nTake thou what course thou wilt!\nTo unify single, auditors into a crowd, express their common\nneeds, aspirations, dangers, and emotions, deliver your mes-\nsage so that the interests of one shall appear to be the in-\nterests of all. The conviction of one man is intensified in pro-\nportion as he finds others sharing his belief\u2014and feeling. An-\ntony does not stop with telling the Roman populace that C\u00e6sar\nfell\u2014he makes the tragedy universal:\nThen I, and you, and all of us fell down,\nWhilst bloody treason flourished over us.\nApplause, generally a sign of feeling, helps to unify an audi-\nence. The nature of the crowd is illustrated by the contagion of\napplause. Recently a throng in a New York moving-picture and\n266\nvaudeville house had been applauding several songs, and when\nan advertisement for tailored skirts was thrown on the screen\nsome one started the applause, and the crowd, like sheep,\nblindly imitated\u2014until someone saw the joke and laughed; then\nthe crowd again followed a leader and laughed at and ap-\nplauded its own stupidity.\nActors sometimes start applause for their lines by snapping\ntheir fingers. Some one in the first few rows will mistake it for\nfaint applause, and the whole theatre will chime in.\nAn observant auditor will be interested in noticing the vari-\nous devices a monologist will use to get the first round of\nlaughter and applause. He works so hard because he knows an\naudience of units is an audience of indifferent critics, but once\nget them to laughing together and each single laugher sweeps\na number of others with him, until the whole theatre is aroar\nand the entertainer has scored. These are meretricious\nschemes, to be sure, and do not savor in the least of inspira-\ntion, but crowds have not changed in their nature in a thou-\nsand years and the one law holds for the greatest preacher and\nthe pettiest stump-speaker\u2014you must fuse your audience or\nthey will not warm to your message. The devices of the great\norator may not be so obvious as those of the vaudeville mono-\nlogist, but the principle is the same: he tries to strike some uni-\nversal note that will have all his hearers feeling alike at the\nsame time.\nis\nThe evangelist knows this when he has the soloist sing some\ntouching song just before the address. Or he will have the en-\nthe psychology of\ntire congregation sing, and that\n\"Now everybody sing!\" for he knows that they who will not join\nin the song are as yet outside the crowd. Many a time has the\npopular evangelist stopped in the middle of his talk, when he\nfelt that his hearers were units instead of a molten mass (and a\nsensitive speaker can feel that condition most depressingly)\nand suddenly demanded that everyone arise and sing, or re-\npeat aloud a familiar passage, or read in unison; or perhaps he\nhas subtly left the thread of his discourse to tell a story that,\nfrom long experience, he knew would not fail to bring his hear-\ners to a common feeling.\nThese things are important resources for the speaker, and\nhappy is he who uses them worthily and not as a despicable\n267\ncharlatan. The difference between a demagogue and a leader\nis not so much a matter of method as of principle. Even the\nmost dignified speaker must recognize the eternal laws of hu-\nman nature. You are by no means urged to become a trickster\non the platform\u2014far from it!\u2014but don't kill your speech with\ndignity. To be icily correct is as silly as to rant. Do neither, but\nappeal to those world-old elements in your audience that have\nbeen recognized by all great speakers from Demosthenes to\nSam Small, and see to it that you never debase your powers by\narousing your hearers unworthily.\nIt is as hard to kindle enthusiasm in a scattered audience as\nto build a fire with scattered sticks. An audience to be conver-\nted into a crowd must be made to appear as a crowd. This can-\nnot be done when they are widely scattered over a large seat-\ning space or when many empty benches separate the speaker\nfrom his hearers. Have your audience seated compactly. How\nmany a preacher has bemoaned the enormous edifice over\nwhich what would normally be a large congregation has\nscattered in chilled and chilling solitude Sunday after Sunday!\nBishop Brooks himself could not have inspired a congregation\nof one thousand souls seated in the vastness of St. Peter's at\nRome. In that colossal sanctuary it is only on great occasions\nwhich bring out the multitudes that the service is before the\nhigh altar\u2014at other times the smaller side-chapels are used.\nUniversal ideas surcharged with feeling help to create the\ncrowd-atmosphere. Examples:\nliberty, character, righteous-\nness, courage, fraternity, altruism, country, and national her-\noes. George Cohan was making psychology practical and profit-\nable when he introduced the flag and flag-songs into his music-\nal comedies. Cromwell's regiments prayed before the battle\nand went into the fight singing hymns. The French corps,\nsinging the Marseillaise in 1914, charged the Germans as one\nman. Such unifying devices arouse the feelings, make soldiers\nfanatical mobs\u2014and, alas, more efficient murderers.\n268\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 25\nINFLUENCING THE CROWD\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "To think, and to feel, constitute the two grand divisions\nof men of genius\u2014the men of reasoning and the men of\nimagination.\n\u2014Isaac Disraeli, Literary Character of Men of Genius.\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\nTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\n\u2014Shakespeare, Midsummer-Night's Dream.\nIt is common, among those who deal chiefly with life's prac-\nticalities, to think of imagination as having little value in com-\nparison with direct thinking. They smile with tolerance when\nEmerson says that \"Science does not know its debt to the ima-\ngination,\" for these are the words of a speculative essayist, a\nphilosopher, a poet. But when Napoleon\u2014the indomitable\nwelder of empires\u2014declares that \"The human race is governed\nby its imagination,\" the authoritative word commands their\nrespect.\nBe it remembered, the faculty of forming mental images is as\nefficient a cog as may be found in the whole mind-machine.\nTrue, it must fit into that other vital cog, pure thought, but\nwhen it does so it may be questioned which is the more pro-\nductive of important results for the happiness and well-being of\nman. This should become more apparent as we go on.\nI. WHAT IS IMAGINATION?\nLet us not seek for a definition, for a score of varying\nones may be found, but let us grasp this fact: By\n269\nimagination we mean either the faculty or the process of\nforming mental images.\nThe subject-matter of imagination may be really existent in\nnature, or not at all real, or a combination of both; it may be\nphysical or spiritual, or both\u2014the mental image is at once the\nmost lawless and the most law-abiding child that has ever been\nborn of the mind.\nFirst of all, as its name suggests, the process of imagina-\ntion\u2014for we are thinking of it now as a process rather than as\na faculty\u2014is memory at work. Therefore we must consider it\nprimarily as\n1. Reproductive Imagination\nWe see or hear or feel or taste or smell something and the\nsensation passes away. Yet we are conscious of a greater or\nlesser ability to reproduce such feelings at will. Two considera-\ntions, in general, will govern the vividness of the image thus\nevoked\u2014the strength of the original impression, and the repro-\nductive power of one mind as compared with another. Yet\nevery normal person will be able to evoke images with some\ndegree of clearness.\nThe fact that not all minds possess this imaging faculty in\nanything like equal measure will have an important bearing on\nthe public speaker's study of this question. No man who does\nnot feel at least some poetic impulses is likely to aspire seri-\nously to be a poet, yet many whose imaging faculties are so\ndormant as to seem actually dead do aspire to be public speak-\ners. To all such we say most earnestly: Awaken your image-\nmaking gift, for even in the most coldly logical discourse it is\nsure to prove of great service. It is important that you find out\nat once just how full and how trustworthy is your imagination,\nfor it is capable of cultivation\u2014as well as of abuse.\nFrancis Galton30 says: \"The French appear to possess the\nvisualizing faculty in a high degree. The peculiar ability they\nshow in pre-arranging ceremonials and f\u00eates of all kinds and\ntheir undoubted genius for tactics and strategy show that they\nare able to foresee effects with unusual clearness. Their in-\ngenuity in all technical contrivances is an additional testimony\nin the same direction, and so is their singular clearness of ex-\npression. Their phrase figurez-vous, or picture to yourself,\n30.Inquiries into Human Faculty.\n270\nseems to express their dominant mode of perception. Our equi-\nvalent, of 'image,' is ambiguous.\"\nBut individuals differ in this respect just as markedly as, for\ninstance, the Dutch do from the French. And this is true not\nonly of those who are classified by their friends as being re-\nspectively imaginative or unimaginative, but of those whose\ngifts or habits are not well known.\nLet us take for experiment six of the best-known types of\nimaging and see in practise how they arise in our own minds.\nBy all odds the most common type is, (a) the visual image.\nChildren who more readily recall things seen than things heard\nare called by psychologists \"eye-minded,\" and most of us are\nbent in this direction. Close your eyes now and re-call\u2014the\nword thus hyphenated is more suggestive\u2014the scene around\nthis morning's breakfast table. Possibly there was nothing\nstriking in the situation and the image is therefore not striking.\nThen image any notable table scene in your experience\u2014how\nvividly it stands forth, because at the time you felt the impres-\nsion strongly. Just then you may not have been conscious of\nhow strongly the scene was laying hold upon you, for often we\nare so intent upon what we see that we give no particular\nthought to the fact that it is impressing us. It may surprise you\nto learn how accurately you are able to image a scene when a\nlong time has elapsed between the conscious focussing of your\nattention on the image and the time when you saw the original.\n(b) The auditory image is probably the next most vivid of our\nrecalled experiences. Here association is potent to suggest\nsimilarities. Close out all the world beside and listen to the\npeculiar wood-against-wood sound of the sharp thunder among\nrocky mountains\u2014the crash of ball against ten-pins may sug-\ngest it. Or image (the word is imperfect, for it seems to suggest\nonly the eye) the sound of tearing ropes when some precious\nweight hangs in danger. Or recall the bay of a hound almost\nupon you in pursuit\u2014choose your own sound, and see how\npleasantly or terribly real it becomes when imaged in your\nbrain.\n(c) The motor image is a close competitor with the auditory\nfor second place. Have you ever awakened in the night, every\nmuscle taut and striving, to feel your self straining against the\nopposing football line that held like a stone-wall\u2014or as firmly\n271\nas the headboard of your bed? Or voluntarily recall the move-\nment of the boat when you cried inwardly, \"It's all up with me!\"\nThe perilous lurch of a train, the sudden sinking of an elevator,\nor the unexpected toppling of a rocking-chair may serve as fur-\nther experiments.\n(d) The gustatory image is common enough, as the idea of\neating lemons will testify. Sometimes the pleasurable recollec-\ntion of a delightful dinner will cause the mouth to water years\nafterward, or the \"image\" of particularly atrocious medicine\nwill wrinkle the nose long after it made one day in boyhood\nwretched.\n(e) The olfactory image is even more delicate. Some there\nare who are affected to illness by the memory of certain odors,\nwhile others experience the most delectable sensations by the\nrise of pleasing olfactory images.\n(f) The tactile image, to name no others, is well nigh as po-\ntent. Do you shudder at the thought of velvet rubbed by short-\nnailed finger tips? Or were you ever \"burned\" by touching an\nice-cold stove? Or, happier memory, can you still feel the touch\nof a well-loved absent hand?\nBe it remembered that few of these images are present in\nour minds except in combination\u2014the sight and sound of the\ncrashing avalanche are one; so are the flash and report of the\nhuntman's gun that came so near \"doing for us.\"\nThus,\nimaging\u2014especially conscious reproductive imagina-\ntion\u2014will become a valuable part of our mental processes in\nproportion as we direct and control it.\n2. Productive Imagination\nAll of the foregoing examples, and doubtless also many of the\nexperiments you yourself may originate, are merely reproduct-\nive. Pleasurable or horrific as these may be, they are far less\nimportant than the images evoked by the productive imagina-\ntion\u2014though that does not infer a separate faculty.\nRecall, again for experiment, some scene whose beginning\nyou once saw enacted on a street corner but passed by before\nthe d\u00e9nouement was ready to be disclosed. Recall it all\u2014that\nfar the image is reproductive. But what followed? Let your\nfantasy roam at pleasure\u2014the succeeding scenes are product-\nive, for you have more or less consciously invented the unreal\non the basis of the real.\n272\nAnd just here the fictionist, the poet, and the public speaker\nwill see the value of productive imagery. True, the feet of the\nidol you build are on the ground, but its head pierces the\nclouds, it is a son of both earth and heaven.\nOne fact it is important to note here: Imagery is a valuable\nmental asset in proportion as it is controlled by the higher in-\ntellectual power of pure reason. The untutored child of nature\nthinks largely in images and therefore attaches to them undue\nimportance. He readily confuses the real with the unreal\u2014to\nhim they are of like value. But the man of training readily dis-\ntinguishes the one from the other and evaluates each with\nsome, if not with perfect, justice.\nSo we see that unrestrained imaging may produce a rudder-\nless steamer, while the trained faculty is the graceful sloop,\nskimming the seas at her skipper's will, her course steadied by\nthe helm of reason and her lightsome wings catching every air\nof heaven.\nThe game of chess, the war-lord's tactical plan, the evolution\nof a geometrical theorem, the devising of a great business cam-\npaign, the elimination of waste in a factory, the d\u00e9nouement of\na powerful drama, the overcoming of an economic obstacle, the\nscheme for a sublime poem, and the convincing siege of an\naudience may\u2014nay, indeed must\u2014each be conceived in an im-\nage and wrought to reality according to the plans and specific-\nations laid upon the trestle board by some modern imaginative\nHiram. The farmer who would be content with the seed he pos-\nsesses would have no harvest. Do not rest satisfied with the\nability to recall images, but cultivate your creative imagination\nby building \"what might be\" upon the foundation of \"what is.\"\nII. THE USES OF IMAGING IN PUBLIC SPEAKING\nBy this time you will have already made some general applic-\nation of these ideas to the art of the platform, but to several\nspecific uses we must now refer.\n1. Imaging in Speech-Preparation\n(a) Set the image of your audience before you while you pre-\npare. Disappointment may lurk here, and you cannot be fore-\narmed for every emergency, but in the main you must meet\n273\nyour audience before you actually do\u2014image its probable mood\nand attitude toward the occasion, the theme, and the speaker.\n(b) Conceive your speech as a whole while you are preparing\nits parts, else can you not see\u2014image\u2014how its parts shall be\nfitly framed together.\n(c) Image the language you will use, so far as written or ex-\ntemporaneous speech may dictate. The habit of imaging will\ngive you choice of varied figures of speech, for remember that\nan address without fresh comparisons is like a garden without\nblooms. Do not be content with the first hackneyed figure that\ncomes flowing to your pen-point, but dream on until the strik-\ning, the unusual, yet the vividly real comparison points your\nthought like steel does the arrow-tip.\nNote the freshness and effectiveness of the following descrip-\ntion from the opening of O. Henry's story, \"The Harbinger.\"\nLong before the springtide is felt in the dull bosom of the\nyokel does the city man know that the grass-green god-\ndess is upon her throne. He sits at his breakfast eggs\nand toast, begirt by stone walls, opens his morning pa-\nper and sees journalism leave vernalism at the post.\nFor whereas Spring's couriers were once the evidence of\nour finer senses, now the Associated Press does the\ntrick.\nThe warble of the first robin in Hackensack, the stirring\nof the maple sap in Bennington, the budding of the pussy\nwillows along the main street in Syracuse, the first chirp\nof the blue bird, the swan song of the blue point, the an-\nnual tornado in St. Louis, the plaint of the peach pessim-\nist from Pompton, N.J., the regular visit of the tame wild\ngoose with a broken leg to the pond near Bilgewater\nJunction, the base attempt of the Drug Trust to boost the\nprice of quinine foiled in the House by Congressman\nJinks, the first tall poplar struck by lightning and\nthe usual stunned picknickers who had taken refuge, the\nfirst crack of the ice jamb in the Allegheny River, the\nfinding of a violet in its mossy bed by the correspondent\nat Round Corners\u2014these are the advanced signs of the\nburgeoning season that are wired into the wise city,\n274\nwhile the farmer sees nothing but winter upon his dreary\nfields.\nBut these be mere externals. The true harbinger is the\nheart. When Strephon seeks his Chloe and Mike his\nMaggie, then only is Spring arrived and the newspaper\nreport of the five foot rattler killed in Squire\nPettregrew's pasture confirmed.\nA hackneyed writer would probably have said that the news-\npaper told the city man about spring before the farmer could\nsee any evidence of it, but that the real harbinger of spring was\nlove and that \"In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns\nto thoughts of love.\"\n2. Imaging in Speech-Delivery\nWhen once the passion of speech is on you and you are\n\"warmed up\"\u2014perhaps by striking till the iron is hot so that\nyou may not fail to strike when it is hot\u2014your mood will be one\nof vision.\nThen (a) Re-image past emotion\u2014of which more elsewhere.\nThe actor re-calls the old feelings every time he renders his\ntelling lines.\n(b) Reconstruct in image the scenes you are to describe.\n(c) Image the objects in nature whose tone you are delineat-\ning, so that bearing and voice and movement (gesture) will pic-\nture forth the whole convincingly. Instead of merely stating the\nfact that whiskey ruins homes, the temperance speaker paints\na drunkard coming home to abuse his wife and strike his chil-\ndren. It is much more effective than telling the truth in ab-\nstract terms. To depict the cruelness of war, do not assert the\nfact abstractly\u2014\"War is cruel.\" Show the soldier, an arm swept\naway by a bursting shell, lying on the battlefield pleading for\nwater; show the children with tear-stained faces pressed\nagainst the window pane praying for their dead father to re-\nturn. Avoid general and prosaic terms. Paint pictures. Evolve\nimages for the imagination of your audience to construct into\npictures of their own.\nIII. HOW TO ACQUIRE THE IMAGING HABIT\n275\nYou remember the American statesman who asserted that\n\"the way to resume is to resume\"? The application is obvious.\nBeginning with the first simple analyses of this chapter, test\nyour own qualities of image-making. One by one practise the\nseveral kinds of images; then add\u2014even invent\u2014others in com-\nbination, for many images come to us in complex form, like the\ncombined noise and shoving and hot odor of a cheering crowd.\nAfter practising on reproductive imaging, turn to the pro-\nductive, beginning with the reproductive and adding product-\nive features for the sake of cultivating invention.\nFrequently, allow your originating gifts full swing by weaving\ncomplete imaginary fabrics\u2014sights, sounds, scenes; all the fine\nworld of fantasy lies open to the journeyings of your winged\nsteed.\nIn like manner train yourself in the use of figurative lan-\nguage. Learn first to distinguish and then to use its varied\nforms. When used with restraint, nothing can be more effective\nthan the trope; but once let extravagance creep in by the win-\ndow, and power will flee by the door.\nAll in all, master your images\u2014let not them master you.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Give original examples of each kind of reproductive\nimagination.\n2. Build two of these into imaginary incidents for platform\nuse, using your productive, or creative, imagination.\n3. Define (a) phantasy; (b) vision; (c) fantastic; (d) phant-\nasmagoria; (e) transmogrify; (f) recollection.\n4. What is a \"figure of speech\"?\n5. Define and give two examples of each of the following fig-\nures of speech31. At least one of the examples under each type\nwould better be original. (a) simile; (b) metaphor; (c) met-\nonymy; (d) synecdoche; (e) apostrophe; (f) vision; (g) personi-\nfication; (h) hyperbole; (i) irony.\n6. (a) What is an allegory? (b) Name one example. (c) How\ncould a short allegory be used as part of a public address?\n31.Consult any good rhetoric. An unabridged dictionary will also be of\nhelp.\n276\n7. Write a short fable32 for use in a speech. Follow either the\nancient form (\u00c6sop) or the modern (George Ade, Josephine\nDodge Daskam).\n8. What do you understand by \"the historical present?\" Illus-\ntrate how it may be used (ONLY occasionally) in a public\naddress.\n9. Recall some disturbance on the street, (a) Describe it as\nyou would on the platform; (b) imagine what preceded the dis-\nturbance; (c) imagine what followed it; (d) connect the whole in\na terse, dramatic narration for the platform and deliver it with\ncareful attention to all that you have learned of the public\nspeaker's art.\n10. Do the same with other incidents you have seen or heard\nof, or read of in the newspapers.\nNOTE: It is hoped that this exercise will be varied and expan-\nded until the pupil has gained considerable mastery of imagin-\native narration. (See chapter on \"Narration.\")\n11. Experiments have proved that the majority of people\nthink most vividly in terms of visual images. However, some\nthink more readily in terms of auditory and motor images. It is\na good plan to mix all kinds of images in the course of your ad-\ndress for you will doubtless have all kinds of hearers. This plan\nwill serve to give variety and strengthen your effects by ap-\npealing to the several senses of each hearer, as well as inter-\nesting many different auditors. For exercise, (a) give several\noriginal examples of compound images, and (b) construct brief\ndescriptions of the scenes imagined. For example, the falling of\na bridge in process of building.\n12. Read the following observantly:\nThe strikers suffered bitter poverty last winter in New\nYork.\nLast winter a woman visiting the East Side of New York\nCity saw another woman coming out of a tenement\nhouse wringing her hands. Upon inquiry the visitor\nfound that a child had fainted in one of the apartments.\nShe entered, and saw the child ill and in rags, while the\nfather, a striker, was too poor to provide medical help. A\n32.For a full discussion of the form see, The Art of Story-Writing, by J.\nBerg Esenwein and Mary D. Chambers.\n277\nphysician was called and said the child had fainted from\nlack of food. The only food in the home was dried fish.\nThe visitor provided groceries for the family and ordered\nthe milkman to leave milk for them daily. A month later\nshe returned. The father of the family knelt down before\nher, and calling her an angel said that she had saved\ntheir lives, for the milk she had provided was all the food\nthey had had.\nIn the two preceding paragraphs we have substantially the\nsame story, told twice. In the first paragraph we have a fact\nstated in general terms. In the second, we have an outline pic-\nture of a specific happening. Now expand this outline into a\ndramatic recital, drawing freely upon your imagination.\n278\n", "metadata": {"heading": "Chapter 26\nRIDING THE WINGED HORSE\n", "content_font": 14, "heading_font": 18, "source": "experimens/books/Carnegie, Dale - The art of public speaking_ the unabridged classic by Carnegie & Esenwein-E-artnow ebooks (2013).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Boys flying kites haul in their white winged birds;\nYou can't do that way when you're flying words.\n\"Careful with fire,\" is good advice we know,\n\"Careful with words,\" is ten times doubly so.\nThoughts unexpressed many sometimes fall back dead;\nBut God Himself can't kill them when they're said.\n\u2014Will Carleton, The First Settler's Story.\nThe term \"vocabulary\" has a special as well as a general\nmeaning. True, all vocabularies are grounded in the everyday\nwords of the language, out of which grow the special vocabu-\nlaries, but each such specialized group possesses a number of\nwords of peculiar value for its own objects. These words may\nbe used in other vocabularies also, but the fact that they are\nsuited to a unique order of expression marks them as of special\nvalue to a particular craft or calling.\nIn this respect the public speaker differs not at all from the\npoet, the novelist, the scientist, the traveler. He must add to\nhis everyday stock, words of value for the public presentation\nof thought. \"A study of the discourses of effective orators dis-\ncloses the fact that they have a fondness for words signifying\npower, largeness, speed, action, color, light, and all their op-\nposites. They frequently employ words expressive of the vari-\nous emotions. Descriptive words, adjectives used in fresh rela-\ntions with nouns, and apt epithets, are freely employed.\nIndeed, the nature of public speech permits the use of mildly\nexaggerated words which, by the time they have reached the\nhearer's judgment, will leave only a just impression.\"33\nForm the Book-Note Habit\n33.How to Attract and Hold an Audience, J. Berg Esenwein.\n279\nTo possess a word involves three things: To know its special\nand broader meanings, to know its relation to other words, and\nto be able to use it. When you see or hear a familiar word used\nin an unfamiliar sense, jot it down, look it up, and master it. We\nhave in mind a speaker of superior attainments who acquired\nhis vocabulary by noting all new words he heard or read. These\nhe mastered and put into use. Soon his vocabulary became\nlarge, varied, and exact. Use a new word accurately five times\nand it is yours. Professor Albert E. Hancock says: \"An author's\nvocabulary is of two kinds, latent and dynamic: latent\u2014those\nwords he understands; dynamic\u2014those he can readily use.\nEvery intelligent man knows all the words he needs, but he\nmay not have them all ready for active service. The problem of\nliterary diction consists in turning the latent into the dynamic.\"\nYour dynamic vocabulary is the one you must especially\ncultivate.\nIn his essay on \"A College Magazine\" in the volume, Memor-\nies and Portraits, Stevenson shows how he rose from imitation\nto originality in the use of words. He had particular reference\nto the formation of his literary style, but words are the raw ma-\nterials of style, and his excellent example may well be followed\njudiciously by the public speaker. Words in their relations are\nvastly more important than words considered singly.\nWhenever I read a book or a passage that particularly\npleased me, in which a thing was said or an effect\nrendered with propriety, in which there was either some\nconspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style,\nI must sit down at once and set myself to ape that qual-\nity. I was unsuccessful, and I knew it; and tried again,\nand was again unsuccessful, and always unsuccessful;\nbut at least in these vain bouts I got some practice in\nrhythm, in harmony, in construction and co\u00f6rdination of\nparts.\nI have thus played the sedulous ape to Hazlitt, to Lamb,\nto Wordsworth, to Sir Thomas Browne, to Defoe, to\nHawthorne, to Montaigne.\nThat, like it or not, is the way to learn to write; whether I\nhave profited or not, that is the way. It was the way\n280\nKeats learned, and there never was a finer temperament\nfor literature than Keats'.\nIt is the great point of these imitations that there still\nshines beyond the student's reach, his inimitable model.\nLet him try as he please, he is still sure of failure; and it\nis an old and very true saying that failure is the only\nhighroad to success.\nForm the Reference-Book Habit\nDo not be content with your general knowledge of a\nword\u2014press your study until you have mastered its individual\nshades of meaning and usage. Mere fluency is sure to become\ndespicable, but accuracy never. The dictionary contains the\ncrystallized usage of intellectual giants. No one who would\nwrite effectively dare despise its definitions and discrimina-\ntions. Think, for example, of the different meanings of mantle,\nor model, or quantity. Any late edition of an unabridged dic-\ntionary is good, and is worth making sacrifices to own.\nBooks of synonyms and antonyms\u2014used cautiously, for there\nare few perfect synonyms in any language\u2014will be found of\ngreat help. Consider the shades of meanings among such word-\ngroups as thief, peculator, defaulter, embezzler, burglar, yegg-\nman, robber, bandit, marauder, pirate, and many more; or the\ndistinctions among Hebrew, Jew, Israelite, and Semite. Re-\nmember that no book of synonyms is trustworthy unless used\nwith a dictionary. \"A Thesaurus of the English Language,\" by\nDr. Francis A. March, is expensive, but full and authoritative.\nOf smaller books of synonyms and antonyms there are plenty.34\nStudy the connectives of English speech. Fernald's book on\nthis title is a mine of gems. Unsuspected pitfalls lie in the loose\ntricky little\nuse ofand, or,\nconnectives.\nfor, while, and a score of\nWord derivations are rich in suggestiveness. Our English\nowes so much to foreign tongues and has changed so much\nwith the centuries that whole addresses may grow out of a\nsingle root-idea hidden away in an ancient word-origin. Trans-\nlation, also, is excellent exercise in word-mastery and consorts\nwell with the study of derivations.\n34.A book of synonyms and antonyms is in preparation for this series, \"The\nWriter's Library.\"\n281\nPhrase books that show the origins of familiar expressions\nwill surprise most of us by showing how carelessly everyday\nspeech is used. Brewer's \"A Dictionary of Phrase, and Fable,\"\nEdwards' \"Words, Facts, and Phrases,\" and Thornton's \"An\nAmerican Glossary,\" are all good\u2014the last, an expensive work\nin three volumes.\nas\nA prefix or a suffix may essentially change the force of the\nstem,\nin master-ful and master-ly, contempt-\nible and contempt-uous, envi-ous and envi-able. Thus to study\nwords in groups, according to their stems, prefixes, and suf-\nfixes is to gain a mastery over their shades of meaning, and in-\ntroduce us to other related words.\nDo not Favor one Set or Kind of Words more than Another\n\"Sixty years and more ago, Lord Brougham, addressing the\nstudents of the University of Glasgow, laid down the rule that\nthe native (Anglo-Saxon) part of our vocabulary was to be\nfavored at the expense of that other part which has come from\nthe Latin and Greek. The rule was an impossible one, and Lord\nBrougham himself never tried seriously to observe it; nor, in\ntruth, has any great writer made the attempt. Not only is our\nlanguage highly composite, but the component words have, in\nDe Quincey's phrase, 'happily coalesced.' It is easy to jest at\nwords in -osity and -ation, as 'dictionary' words, and the like.\nBut even Lord Brougham would have found it difficult to dis-\npense with pomposity and imagination.\"35\nThe short, vigorous Anglo-Saxon will always be preferred for\npassages of special thrust and force, just as the Latin will con-\ntinue to furnish us with flowing and smooth expressions; to\nmingle all sorts, however, will give variety\u2014and that is most to\nbe desired.\nDiscuss Words With Those Who Know Them\nSince the language of the platform follows closely the diction\nof everyday speech, many useful words may be acquired in\nconversation with cultivated men, and when such discussion\ntakes the form of disputation as to the meanings and usages of\nwords, it will prove doubly valuable. The development of word-\npower marches with the growth of individuality.\nSearch Faithfully for the Right Word\n35.Composition and Rhetoric, J.M. Hart.\n282\nBooks of reference are tripled in value when their owner has\na passion for getting the kernels out of their shells. Ten\nminutes a day will do wonders for the nut-cracker. \"I am grow-\ning so peevish about my writing,\" says Flaubert. \"I am like a\nman whose ear is true, but who plays falsely on the violin: his\nfingers refuse to reproduce precisely those sounds of which he\nhas the inward sense. Then the tears come rolling down from\nthe poor scraper's eyes and the bow falls from his hand.\"\nThe same brilliant Frenchman sent this sound advice to his\npupil, Guy de Maupassant: \"Whatever may be the thing which\none wishes to say, there is but one word for expressing it, only\none verb to animate it, only one adjective to qualify it. It is es-\nsential to search for this word, for this verb, for this adjective,\nuntil they are discovered, and to be satisfied with nothing\nelse.\"\nWalter Savage Landor once wrote: \"I hate false words, and\nseek with care, difficulty, and moroseness those that fit the\nthing.\" So did Sentimental Tommy, as related by James M. Bar-\nrie in his novel bearing his hero's name as a title. No wonder T.\nSandys became an author and a lion!\nTommy, with another lad, is writing an essay on \"A Day in\nChurch,\" in competition for a university scholarship. He gets\non finely until he pauses for lack of a word. For nearly an hour\nhe searches for this elusive thing, until suddenly he is told that\nthe allotted time is up, and he has lost! Barrie may tell the rest:\nEssay! It was no more an essay than a twig is a tree, for\nthe gowk had stuck in the middle of his second page.\nYes, stuck is the right expression, as his chagrined\nteacher had to admit when the boy was cross-examined.\nHe had not been \"up to some of his tricks;\" he had stuck,\nand his explanations, as you will admit, merely emphas-\nized his incapacity.\nHe had brought himself to public scorn for lack of a\nword. What word? they asked testily; but even now he\ncould not tell. He had wanted a Scotch word that would\nsignify how many people were in church, and it was on\nthe tip of his tongue, but would come no farther. Puckle\nwas nearly the word, but it did not mean so many people\nas he meant. The hour had gone by just like winking; he\n283\nhad forgotten all about time while searching his mind for\nthe word.\nMr. Ogilvy \u2026 said in an ecstasy to himself, \"He had to\nthink of it till he got it\u2014and he got it. The laddie is a\ngenius!\"\nThe other five [examiners] were furious\u2026 . \"You little\ntattie doolie,\" Cathro roared, \"were there not a dozen\nwords to wile from if you had an ill-will to puckle? What\nailed you at manzy, or\u2014\"\n\"I thought of manzy,\" replied Tommy, woefully, for he\nwas ashamed of himself, \"but\u2014but a manzy's a swarm. It\nwould mean that the folk in the kirk were buzzing\nthegither like bees, instead of sitting still.\"\n\"Even if it does mean that,\" said Mr. Duthie, with impa-\ntience, \"what was the need of being so particular? Surely\nthe art of essay-writing consists in using the first word\nthat comes and hurrying on.\"\n\"That's how I did,\" said the proud McLauchlan [Tommy's\nsuccessful competitor]\u2026 .\n\"I see,\" interposed Mr. Gloag, \"that McLauchlan speaks\nof there being a mask of people in the church. Mask is a\nfine Scotch word.\"\n\"I thought of mask,\" whimpered Tommy, \"but that would\nmean the kirk was crammed, and I just meant it to be\nmiddling full.\"\n\"Flow would have done,\" suggested Mr. Lonimer.\n\"Flow's but a handful,\" said Tommy.\n\"Curran, then, you jackanapes!\"\n\"Curran's no enough.\"\nMr. Lorrimer flung up his hands in despair.\n\"I wanted something between curran and mask,\" said\nTommy, doggedly, yet almost at the crying.\nMr. Ogilvy, who had been hiding his admiration with dif-\nficulty, spread a net for him. \"You said you wanted a\nword that meant middling full. Well, why did you not say\nmiddling full\u2014or fell mask?\"\n\"Yes, why not?\" demanded the ministers, unconsciously\ncaught in the net.\n284\n\"I wanted one word,\" replied Tommy, unconsciously\navoiding it.\n\"You jewel!\" muttered Mr. Ogilvy under his breath, but\nMr. Cathro would have banged the boy's head had not\nthe ministers interfered.\n\"It is so easy, too, to find the right word,\" said Mr. Gloag.\n\"It's no; it's difficult as to hit a squirrel,\" cried Tommy,\nand again Mr. Ogilvy nodded approval.\nAnd then an odd thing happened. As they were prepar-\ning to leave the school [Cathro having previously run\nTommy out by the neck], the door opened a little and\nthere appeared in the aperture the face of Tommy, tear-\nstained but excited. \"I ken the word now,\" he cried, \"it\ncame to me a' at once; it is hantle!\"\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

We all agree that a reliable\nmemory is an invaluable possession for the speaker. We never\ndissent for a moment when we are solemnly told that his\nmemory should be a storehouse from which at pleasure he can\n287\ndraw facts, fancies, and illustrations. But can the memory be\ntrained to act as the warder for all the truths that we have\ngained from thinking, reading, and experience? And if so, how?\nLet us see.\nTwenty years ago a poor immigrant boy, employed as a dish\nwasher in New York, wandered into the Cooper Union and\nbegan to read a copy of Henry George's \"Progress and\nPoverty.\" His passion for knowledge was awakened, and he be-\ncame a habitual reader. But he found that he was not able to\nremember what he read, so he began to train his naturally poor\nmemory until he became the world's greatest memory expert.\nThis man was the late Mr. Felix Berol. Mr. Berol could tell the\npopulation of any town in the world, of more than five thou-\nsand inhabitants. He could recall the names of forty strangers\nwho had just been introduced to him and was able to tell which\nhad been presented third, eighth, seventeenth, or in any order.\nHe knew the date of every important event in history, and\ncould not only recall an endless array of facts but could correl-\nate them perfectly.\nTo what extent Mr. Berol's remarkable memory was natural\nand required only attention, for its development, seems im-\npossible to determine with exactness, but the evidence clearly\nindicates that, however useless were many of his memory\nfeats, a highly retentive memory was developed where before\nonly \"a good forgettery\" existed.\nThe freak memory is not worth striving for, but a good work-\ning memory decidedly is. Your power as a speaker will depend\nto a large extent upon your ability to retain impressions and\ncall them forth when occasion demands, and that sort of\nmemory is like muscle\u2014it responds to training.\nWhat Not to Do\nIt is sheer misdirected effort to begin to memorize by learn-\ning words by rote, for that is beginning to build a pyramid at\nthe apex. For years our schools were cursed by this vicious sys-\ntem\u2014vicious not only because it is inefficient but for the more\nimportant reason that it hurts the mind. True, some minds are\nnatively endowed with a wonderful facility in remembering\nstrings of words, facts, and figures, but such are rarely good\nreasoning minds; the normal person must belabor and force\nthe memory to acquire in this artificial way.\n288\nAgain, it is hurtful to force the memory in hours of physical\nweakness or mental weariness. Health is the basis of the best\nmental action and the operation of memory is no exception.\nFinally, do not become a slave to a system. Knowledge of a\nfew simple facts of mind and memory will set you to work at\nthe right end of the operation. Use these principles, whether\nincluded in a system or not, but do not bind yourself to a meth-\nod that tends to lay more stress on the way to remember than\non the development of memory itself. It is nothing short of ri-\ndiculous to memorize ten words in order to remember one fact.\nThe Natural Laws of Memory\nConcentrated attention at the time when you wish to store\nthe mind is the first step in memorizing\u2014and the most import-\nant one by far. You forgot the fourth of the list of articles your\nwife asked you to bring home chiefly because you allowed your\nattention to waver for an instant when she was telling you. At-\ntention may not be concentrated attention. When a siphon is\ncharged with gas it is sufficiently filled with the carbonic acid\nvapor to make its influence felt; a mind charged with an idea is\ncharged to a degree sufficient to hold it. Too much charging\nwill make the siphon burst; too much attention to trifles leads\nto insanity. Adequate attention, then, is the fundamental secret\nof remembering.\nGenerally we do not give a fact adequate attention when it\ndoes not seem important. Almost everyone has seen how the\nseeds in an apple point, and has memorized the date of\nWashington's death. Most of us have\u2014perhaps wisely\u2014forgot-\nten both. The little nick in the bark of a tree is healed over and\nobliterated in a season, but the gashes in the trees around\nGettysburg are still apparent after fifty years. Impressions that\nare gathered lightly are soon obliterated. Only deep impres-\nsions can be recalled at will. Henry Ward Beecher said: \"One\nintense hour will do more than dreamy years.\" To memorize\nideas and words, concentrate on them until they are fixed\nfirmly and deeply in your mind and accord to them their true\nimportance. Listen with the mind and you will remember.\nHow shall you concentrate? How would you increase the\nfighting-effectiveness of a man-of-war? One vital way would be\nto increase the size and number of its guns. To strengthen your\nincrease both the number and the force of your\nmemory,\n289\nimpressions by attending to them intensely. Loose,\nmental\nskimming reading, and drifting habits of reading destroy\nmemory power. However, as most books and newspapers do\nnot warrant any other kind of attention, it will not do altogeth-\ner to condemn this method of reading; but avoid it when you\nare trying to memorize.\nEnvironment has a strong influence upon concentration, until\nyou have learned to be alone in a crowd and undisturbed by\nclamor. When you set out to memorize a fact or a speech, you\nmay find the task easier away from all sounds and moving ob-\njects. All impressions foreign to the one you desire to fix in\nyour mind must be eliminated.\nThe next great step in memorizing is to pick out the essen-\ntials of the subject, arrange them in order, and dwell upon\nthem intently. Think clearly of each essential, one after the oth-\ner. Thinking a thing\u2014not allowing the mind to wander to non-\nessentials\u2014is really memorizing.\nAssociation of ideas is universally recognized as an essential\nin memory work; indeed, whole systems of memory training\nhave been founded on this principle.\nMany speakers memorize only the outlines of their ad-\ndresses, filling in the words at the moment of speaking. Some\nhave found it helpful to remember an outline by associating the\ndifferent points with objects in the room. Speaking on \"Peace,\"\nyou may wish to dwell on the cost the cruelty, and the failure\nof war, and so lead to the justice of arbitration. Before going on\nthe platform if you will associate four divisions of your outline\nwith four objects in the room, this association may help you to\nrecall them. You may be prone to forget your third point, but\nyou remember that once when you were speaking the electric\nlights failed, so arbitrarily the electric light globe will help you\nto remember \"failure.\" Such associations, being unique, tend to\nstick in the mind. While recently speaking on the six kinds of\nimagination the present writer formed them into an ac-\nrostic\u2014visual, auditory, motor, gustatory, olfactory, and tactile,\nfurnished the nonsense word vamgot, but the six points were\neasily remembered.\nIn the same way that children are taught to remember the\nspelling of teasing words\u2014separate comes from separ\u2014and as\nan automobile driver remembers that two C's and then two H's\n290\nlead him into Castor Road, Cottman Street, Haynes Street and\nHenry Street, so important points in your address may be fixed\nin mind by arbitrary symbols invented by yourself. The very\nwork of devising the scheme is a memory action. The psycholo-\ngical process is simple: it is one of noting intently the steps by\nwhich a fact, or a truth, or even a word, has come to you. Take\nadvantage of this tendency of the mind to remember by\nassociation.\nRepetition is a powerful aid to memory. Thurlow Weed, the\njournalist and political leader, was troubled because he so eas-\nily forgot the names of persons he met from day to day. He cor-\nrected the weakness, relates Professor William James, by form-\ning the habit of attending carefully to names he had heard dur-\ning the day and then repeating them to his wife every evening.\nDoubtless Mrs. Weed was heroically longsuffering, but the\ndevice worked admirably.\nAfter reading a passage you would remember, close the\nbook, reflect, and repeat the contents\u2014aloud, if possible.\nReading thoughtfully aloud has been found by many to be a\nhelpful memory practise.\nWrite what you wish to remember. This is simply one more\nway of increasing the number and the strength of your mental\nimpressions by utilizing all your avenues of impression. It will\nhelp to fix a speech in your mind if you speak it aloud, listen to\nit, write it out, and look at it intently. You have then impressed\nit on your mind by means of vocal, auditory, muscular and visu-\nal impressions.\nSome folk have peculiarly distinct auditory memories; they\nare able to recall things heard much better than things seen.\nOthers have the visual memory; they are best able to recall\nsight-impressions. As you recall a walk you have taken, are you\nable to remember better the sights or the sounds? Find out\nwhat kinds of impressions your memory retains best, and use\nthem the most. To fix an idea in mind, use every possible kind\nof impression.\nDaily habit is a great memory cultivator. Learn a lesson from\nthe Marathon runner. Regular exercise, though never so little\ndaily, will strengthen your memory in a surprising measure.\nTry to describe in detail the dress, looks and manner of the\npeople you pass on the street. Observe the room you are in,\n291\nclose your eyes, and describe its contents. View closely the\nlandscape, and write out a detailed description of it. How much\ndid you miss? Notice the contents of the show windows on the\nstreet; how many features are you able to recall? Continual\npractise in this feat may develop in you as remarkable profi-\nciency as it did in Robert Houdin and his son.\nThe daily memorizing of a beautiful passage in literature will\nnot only lend strength to the memory, but will store the mind\nwith gems for quotation. But whether by little or much add\ndaily to your memory power by practise.\nLastly, cast\nMemorize out of doors. The buoyancy of the wood, the shore,\nor the stormy night on deserted streets may freshen your mind\nas it does the minds of countless others.\nTell\nout\nthat\nyou can and will and do remember. By pure exercise of selfism\nassert your mastery. Be obsessed with the fear of forgetting\nand you cannot remember. Practise the reverse. Throw aside\nyour manuscript crutches\u2014you may tumble once or twice, but\nwhat matters that, for you are going to learn to walk and leap\nand run.\nyourself\nfear.\nMemorizing a Speech\nNow let us try to put into practise the foregoing suggestions.\nFirst, reread this chapter, noting the nine ways by which mem-\norizing may be helped.\nThen read over the following selection from Beecher, apply-\ning so many of the suggestions as are practicable. Get the spir-\nit of the selection firmly in your mind. Make mental note\nideas. Now\nof\u2014write down,\nmemorize the thought. Then memorize the outline, the order in\nwhich the different ideas are expressed. Finally, memorize the\nexact wording.\nif you must\u2014the succession of\nNo, when you have done all this, with the most faithful atten-\ntion to directions, you will not find memorizing easy, unless\nyou have previously trained your memory, or it is naturally re-\ntentive. Only by constant practise will memory become strong\nand only by continually observing these same principles will it\nremain strong. You will, however, have made a beginning, and\nthat is no mean matter.\nTHE REIGN OF THE COMMON PEOPLE\n292\nI do not suppose that if you were to go and look upon the\nexperiment of self-government in America you would\nhave a very high opinion of it. I have not either, if I just\nlook upon the surface of things. Why, men will say: \"It\nstands to reason that 60,000,000 ignorant of law, ignor-\nant of constitutional history, ignorant of jurisprudence,\nof finance, and taxes and tariffs and forms of cur-\nrency\u201460,000,000 people that never studied these\nthings\u2014are not fit to rule.\" Your diplomacy is as complic-\nated as ours, and it is the most complicated on earth, for\nall things grow in complexity as they develop toward a\nhigher condition. What fitness is there in these people?\nWell, it is not democracy merely; it is a representative\ndemocracy. Our people do not vote in mass for anything;\nthey pick out captains of thought, they pick out the men\nthat do know, and they send them to the Legislature to\nthink for them, and then the people afterward ratify or\ndisallow them.\nBut when you come to the Legislature I am bound to\nconfess that the thing does not look very much more\ncheering on the outside. Do they really select the best\nmen? Yes; in times of danger they do very generally, but\nin ordinary time, \"kissing goes by favor.\" You know what\nthe duty of a regular Republican-Democratic legislator\nis. It is to get back again next winter. His second duty is\nwhat? His second duty is to put himself under that ex-\ntraordinary providence that takes care of legislators'\nsalaries. The old miracle of the prophet and the meal and\nthe oil is outdone immeasurably in our days, for they go\nthere poor one year, and go home rich; in four years they\nbecome moneylenders, all by a trust in that gracious\nprovidence that takes care of legislators' salaries. Their\nnext duty after that is to serve the party that sent them\nup, and then, if there is anything left of them, it belongs\nto the commonwealth. Someone has said very wisely,\nthat if a man traveling wishes to relish his dinner he had\nbetter not go into the kitchen to see where it is cooked;\nif a man wishes to respect and obey the law, he had bet-\nter not go to the Legislature to see where that is cooked.\n\u2014Henry Ward Beecher.\n293\nFrom a lecture delivered in Exeter Hall, London, 1886, when\nmaking his last tour of Great Britain.\nIn Case of Trouble\nBut what are you to do if, notwithstanding all your efforts,\nyou should forget your points, and your mind, for the minute,\nbecomes blank? This is a deplorable condition that sometimes\narises and must be dealt with. Obviously, you can sit down and\nadmit defeat. Such a consummation is devoutly to be shunned.\nWalking slowly across the platform may give you time to grip\nyourself, compose your thoughts, and stave off disaster. Per-\nhaps the surest and most practical method is to begin a new\nsentence with your last important word. This is not advocated\nas a method of composing a speech\u2014it is merely an extreme\nmeasure which may save you in tight circumstances. It is like\nthe fire department\u2014the less you must use it the better. If this\nmethod is followed very long you are likely to find yourself talk-\ning about plum pudding or Chinese Gordon in the most unex-\npected manner, so of course you will get back to your lines the\nearliest moment that your feet have hit the platform.\nLet us see how this plan works\u2014obviously, your extempor-\nized words will lack somewhat of polish, but in such a pass\ncrudity is better than failure.\nNow you have come to a dead wall after saying: \"Joan of Arc\nfought for liberty.\" By this method you might get something\nlike this:\n\"Liberty is a sacred privilege for which mankind always had\nto fight. These struggles [Platitude\u2014but push on] fill the pages\nof history. History records the gradual triumph of the serf over\nthe lord, the slave over the master. The master has continually\ntried to usurp unlimited powers. Power during the medieval\nages accrued to the owner of the land with a spear and a\nstrong castle; but the strong castle and spear were of little\navail after the discovery of gunpowder. Gunpowder was the\ngreatest boon that liberty had ever known.\"\nThus far you have linked one idea with another rather obvi-\nously, but you are getting your second wind now and may ven-\nture to relax your grip on the too-evident chain; and so you say:\n\"With gunpowder the humblest serf in all the land could put\nan end to the life of the tyrannical baron behind the castle\n294\nwalls. The struggle for liberty, with gunpowder as its aid,\nwrecked empires, and built up a new era for all mankind.\"\nIn a moment more you have gotten back to your outline and\nthe day is saved.\nPractising exercises like the above will not only fortify you\nagainst the death of your speech when your memory misses\nfire, but it will also provide an excellent training for fluency in\nspeaking. Stock up with ideas.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. Pick out and state briefly the nine helps to memorizing\nsuggested in this chapter.\n2.

Schaeffer, Thinking and Learning to Think.\nThe speaker's most valuable possession is personality\u2014that\nindefinable, imponderable something which sums up what we\nare, and makes us different from others; that distinctive force\nof self which operates appreciably on those whose lives we\ntouch. It is personality alone that makes us long for higher\nthings. Rob us of our sense of individual life, with its gains and\nits duties and joys, and we grovel. \"Few human\nlosses,\ncreatures,\" says John Stuart Mill, \"would consent\nto be\nchanged into any of the lower animals for a promise of the\nfullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human\nbeing would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would\nbe an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be\nselfish and base, even though he should be persuaded that the\nfool, or the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot\nthan they with theirs\u2026 . It is better to be a human being dissat-\nisfied than a pig satisfied, better to be a Socrates dissatisfied\nthan a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig is of a different\nopinion, it is only because they know only their own side of the\nquestion. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\"\nNow it is precisely because the Socrates type of person lives\non the plan of right thinking and restrained feeling and willing\nthat he prefers his state to that of the animal. All that a man is,\n296\nall his happiness, his sorrow, his achievements, his failures, his\nmagnetism, his weakness, all are in an amazingly large meas-\nure the direct results of his thinking. Thought and heart com-\nbine to produce rightthinking: \"As a man thinketh in his heart\nso is he.\" As he does not think in his heart so he can never\nbecome.\nSince this is true, personality can be developed and its latent\npowers brought out by careful cultivation. We have long since\nceased to believe that we are living in a realm of chance. So\nclear and exact are nature's laws that we forecast, scores of\nyears in advance, the appearance of a certain comet and fore-\ntell to the minute an eclipse of the Sun. And we understand\nthis law of cause and effect in all our material realms. We do\nnot plant potatoes and expect to pluck hyacinths. The law is\nuniversal: it applies to our mental powers, to morality, to per-\nsonality, quite as much as to the heavenly bodies and the grain\nof the fields. \"Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also\nreap,\" and nothing else.\nCharacter has always been regarded as one of the chief\nfactors of the speaker's power. Cato defined the orator as vir\nbonus dicendi peritus\u2014a good man skilled in speaking. Phillips\nBrooks says: \"Nobody can truly stand as a utterer before the\nworld, unless he be profoundly living and earnestly thinking.\"\n\"Character,\" says Emerson, \"is a natural power, like light and\nheat, and all nature cooperates with it. The reason why we feel\none man's presence, and do not feel another's is as simple as\ngravity. Truth is the summit of being: justice is the application\nof it to affairs. All individual natures stand in a scale, according\nto the purity of this element in them. The will of the pure runs\ndown into other natures, as water runs down from a higher in-\nto a lower vessel. This natural force is no more to be withstood\nthan any other natural force\u2026 . Character is nature in the\nhighest form.\"\nIt is absolutely impossible for impure, bestial and selfish\nthoughts to blossom into loving and altruistic habits. Thistle\nseeds bring forth only the thistle. Contrariwise, it is entirely\nimpossible for continual altruistic, sympathetic, and serviceful\nthoughts to bring forth a low and vicious character. Either\nthoughts or feelings precede and determine all our actions. Ac-\ntions develop into habits, habits constitute character, and\n297\ncharacter determines destiny. Therefore to guard our thoughts\nand control our feelings is to shape our destinies. The syllo-\ngism is complete, and old as it is it is still true.\nSince \"character is nature in the highest form,\" the develop-\nment of character must proceed on natural lines. The garden\nleft to itself will bring forth weeds and scrawny plants, but the\nflower-beds nurtured carefully will blossom into fragrance and\nbeauty.\nAs the student entering college largely determines his voca-\ntion by choosing from the different courses of the curriculum,\nso do we choose our characters by choosing our thoughts. We\nare steadily going up toward that which we most wish for, or\nsteadily sinking to the level of our low desires. What we\nsecretly cherish in our hearts is a symbol of what we shall re-\nceive. Our trains of thoughts are hurrying us on to our destiny.\nWhen you see the flag fluttering to the South, you know the\nwind is coming from the North. When you see the straws and\npapers being carried to the Northward you realize the wind is\nblowing out of the South. It is just as easy to ascertain a man's\nthoughts by observing the tendency of his character.\nLet it not be suspected for one moment that all this is merely\na preachment on the question of morals. It is that, but much\nmore, for it touches the whole man\u2014his imaginative nature, his\nability to control his feelings, the mastery of his thinking fac-\nulties, and\u2014perhaps most largely\u2014his power to will and to\ncarry his volitions into effective action.\nRight thinking constantly assumes that the will sits en-\nthroned to execute the dictates of mind, conscience and\nheart. Never tolerate for an instant the suggestion that your\nwill is not absolutely efficient. The way to will is to will\u2014and\nthe very first time you are tempted to break a worthy resolu-\ntion\u2014and you will be, you may be certain of that\u2014make your\nfight then and there. You cannot afford to lose that fight.\nYou must win it\u2014don't swerve for an instant, but keep that res-\nolution if it kills you. It will not, but you must fight just as\nthough life depended on the victory; and indeed your personal-\nity may actually lie in the balances!\nYour success or failure as a speaker will be determined very\nlargely by your thoughts and your mental attitude. The present\nwriter had a student of limited education enter one of his\n298\nclasses in public speaking. He proved to be a very poor speak-\ner; and the instructor could conscientiously do little but point\nout faults. However, the young man was warned not to be dis-\ncouraged. With sorrow in his voice and the essence of earnest-\nness beaming from his eyes, he replied: \"I will not be discour-\naged! I want so badly to know how to speak!\" It was warm, hu-\nman, and from the very heart. And he did keep on trying\u2014and\ndeveloped into a creditable speaker.\nThere is no power under the stars that can defeat a man with\nthat attitude. He who down in the deeps of his heart earnestly\nlongs to get facility in speaking, and is willing to make the sac-\nrifices necessary, will reach his goal. \"Ask and ye shall receive;\nseek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you,\"\nis indeed applicable to those who would acquire speech-power.\nYou will not realize the prize that you wish for languidly, but\nthe goal that you start out to attain with the spirit of the old\nguard that dies but never surrenders, you will surely reach.\nYour belief in your ability and your willingness to make sacri-\nfices for that belief, are the double index to your future\nachievements. Lincoln had a dream of his possibilities as a\nspeaker. He transmuted that dream into life solely because he\nwalked many miles to borrow books which he read by the log-\nfire glow at night. He sacrificed much to realize his vision. Liv-\ningstone had a great faith in his ability to serve the benighted\nraces of Africa. To actualize that faith he gave up all. Leaving\nEngland for the interior of the Dark Continent he struck the\ndeath blow to Europe's profits from the slave trade. Joan of Arc\nhad great self-confidence, glorified by an infinite capacity for\nsacrifice. She drove the English beyond the Loire, and stood\nbeside Charles while he was crowned.\nThese all realized their strongest desires. The law is univer-\nsal. Desire greatly, and you shall achieve; sacrifice much, and\nyou shall obtain.\nStanton Davis Kirkham has beautifully expressed this\nthought: \"You may be keeping accounts, and presently you\nshall walk out of the door that has for so long seemed to you\nthe barrier of your ideals, and shall find yourself before an\naudience\u2014the pen still behind your ear, the ink stains on your\nfingers\u2014and then and there shall pour out the torrent of your\ninspiration. You may be driving sheep, and you shall wander to\n299\nthe city\u2014bucolic and open-mouthed; shall wander under the in-\ntrepid guidance of the spirit into the studio of the master, and\nafter a time he shall say, 'I have nothing more to teach you.'\nAnd now you have become the master, who did so recently\ndream of great things while driving sheep. You shall lay down\nthe saw and the plane to take upon yourself the regeneration\nof the world.\"\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1. What, in your own words, is personality?\n2.

When\nMark Twain addressed the Army of the Tennessee in reunion at\nChicago, in 1877, he responded to the toast, \"The Babies.\" Two\nthings in that after-dinner speech are remarkable: the bright\nintroduction, by which he subtly claimed the interest of all, and\nthe humorous use of military terms throughout:\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen: \"The Babies.\" Now, that's\nsomething like. We haven't all had the good fortune to\nbe ladies; we have not all been generals, or poets, or\nstatesmen; but when the toast works down to the babies,\nwe stand on common ground\u2014for we've all been babies.\nIt is a shame that for a thousand years the world's ban-\nquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't\namount to anything! If you, gentlemen, will stop and\nthink a minute\u2014if you will go back fifty or a hundred\nyears, to your early married life, and recontemplate your\nfirst baby\u2014you will remember that he amounted to a\ngood deal\u2014and even something over.\n\"As a vessel is known by the sound, whether it be cracked or\nnot,\" said Demosthenes, \"so men are proved by their speeches\nwhether they be wise or foolish.\" Surely the occasional address\nfurnishes a severe test of a speaker's wisdom. To be trivial on a\nserious occasion, to be funereal at a banquet, to be long-win-\nded ever\u2014these are the marks of non-sense. Some imprudent\nsouls seem to select the most friendly of after-dinner occasions\nfor the explosion of a bomb-shell of dispute. Around the dinner\ntable it is the custom of even political enemies to bury their\nhatchets anywhere rather than in some convenient skull. It is\nthe height of bad taste to raise questions that in hours consec-\nrated to good-will can only irritate.\nOccasional speeches offer good chances for humor, particu-\nlarly the funny story, for humor with a genuine point is not\ntrivial. But do not spin a whole skein of humorous yarns with\nno more connection than the inane and threadbare \"And that\nreminds me.\" An anecdote without bearing may be funny but\none less funny that fits theme and occasion is far preferable.\n302\nThere is no way, short of sheer power of speech, that so surely\nleads to the heart of an audience as rich, appropriate humor.\nThe scattered diners in a great banqueting hall, the after-din-\nner lethargy, the anxiety over approaching last-train time, the\nover-full list of over-full speakers\u2014all throw out a challenge to\nthe speaker to do his best to win an interested hearing. And\nwhen success does come it is usually due to a happy mixture of\nseriousness and humor, for humor alone rarely scores so heav-\nily\ngrave\ncombined, while\nspeech never does on such occasions.\nutterly\ntwo\nthe\nthe\nas\nIf there is one place more than another where second-hand\nopinions and platitudes are unwelcome it is in the after-dinner\nspeech.

How is it possible to summarize the qualities that go to\nmake up the good after-dinner speech, when we remember the\ninimitable serious-drollery of Mark Twain, the sweet southern\neloquence of Henry W. Grady, the funereal gravity of the hu-\nmorous Charles Battell Loomis, the charm of Henry Van Dyke,\nthe geniality of F. Hopkinson Smith, and the all-round delight-\nfulness of Chauncey M. Depew? America is literally rich in\nsuch gladsome speakers, who punctuate real sense with non-\nsense, and so make both effective.\nCommemorative occasions, unveilings,\ncommencements,\ndedications, eulogies, and all the train of special public gather-\nings, offer rare opportunities for the display of tact and good\nsense in handling occasion, theme, and audience. When to be\ndignified and when colloquial, when to soar and when to\nramble arm in arm with your hearers, when to flame and when\nto soothe, when to instruct and when to amuse\u2014in a word, the\nwhole matter of APPROPRIATENESS must constantly be in\nmind lest you write your speech on water.\nFinally, remember the beatitude: Blessed is the man that\nmaketh short speeches, for he shall be invited to speak again.\nSELECTIONS FOR STUDY\nLAST DAYS OF THE CONFEDERACY\n(Extract)\nThe Rapidan suggests another scene to which allusion\nhas often been made since the war, but which, as\n303\nillustrative also of the spirit of both armies, I may be per-\nmitted to recall in this connection. In the mellow twilight\nof an April day the two armies were holding their dress\nparades on the opposite hills bordering the river. At the\nclose of the parade a magnificent brass band of the\nUnion army played with great spirit the patriotic airs,\n\"Hail Columbia,\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\" Whereupon the\nFederal troops responded with a patriotic shout. The\nsame band then played the soul-stirring strains of\n\"Dixie,\" to which a mighty response came from ten thou-\nsand Southern troops. A few moments later, when the\nstars had come out as witnesses and when all nature was\nin harmony, there came from the same band the old\nmelody, \"Home, Sweet Home.\" As its familiar and pathet-\nic notes rolled over the water and thrilled through the\nspirits of the soldiers, the hills reverberated with a thun-\ndering response from the united voices of both armies.\nWhat was there in this old, old music, to so touch the\nchords of sympathy, so thrill the spirits and cause the\nframes of brave men to tremble with emotion? It was the\nthought of home. To thousands, doubtless, it was the\nthought of that Eternal Home to which the next battle\nmight be the gateway. To thousands of others it was the\nthought of their dear earthly homes, where loved ones at\nthat twilight hour were bowing round the family altar,\nand asking God's care over the absent soldier boy.\n\u2014General J.B. Gordon, C.s.a.\nWELCOME TO KOSSUTH\n(Extract)\nLet me ask you to imagine that the contest, in which the\nUnited States asserted their independence of Great Bri-\ntain, had been unsuccessful; that our armies, through\ntreason or a league of tyrants against us, had been\nbroken and scattered; that the great men who led them,\nand who swayed our councils\u2014our Washington, our\nFranklin, and the venerable president of the American\nCongress\u2014had been driven forth as exiles. If there had\nexisted at that day, in any part of the civilized world, a\npowerful Republic, with institutions resting on the same\nfoundations of liberty which our own countrymen sought\n304\nto establish, would there have been in that Republic any\nhospitality too cordial, any sympathy too deep, any zeal\nfor their glorious but unfortunate cause, too fervent or\ntoo active to be shown toward these illustrious fugitives?\nGentlemen, the case I have supposed is before you. The\nWashingtons, the Franklins, the Hancocks of Hungary,\ndriven out by a far worse tyranny than was ever endured\nhere, are wanderers in foreign lands. Some of them have\nsought a refuge in our country\u2014one sits with this com-\npany our guest to-night\u2014and we must measure the duty\nwe owe them by the same standard which we would\nhave had history apply, if our ancestors had met with a\nfate like theirs.\n\u2014William Cullen Bryant.\nTHE INFLUENCE OF UNIVERSITIES\n(Extract)\nWhen the excitement of party warfare presses danger-\nously near our national safeguards, I would have the in-\ntelligent conservatism of our universities and colleges\nwarn the contestants in impressive tones against the\nperils of a breach impossible to repair.\nWhen popular discontent and passion are stimulated by\nthe arts of designing partisans to a pitch perilously near\nto class hatred or sectional anger, I would have our uni-\nversities and colleges sound the alarm in the name of\nAmerican brotherhood and fraternal dependence.\nWhen the attempt is made to delude the people into the\nbelief that their suffrages can change the operation of\nnational laws, I would have our universities and colleges\nproclaim that those laws are inexorable and far removed\nfrom political control.\nWhen selfish interest seeks undue private benefits\nthrough governmental aid, and public places are claimed\nas rewards of party service, I would have our universit-\nies and colleges persuade the people to a relinquishment\nof the demand for party spoils and exhort them to a dis-\ninterested and patriotic love of their government, whose\nunperverted operation secures to every citizen his just\nshare of the safety and prosperity it holds in store for all.\n305\nI would have the influence of these institutions on the\nside of religion and morality. I would have those they\nsend out among the people not ashamed to acknowledge\nGod, and to proclaim His interposition in the affairs of\nmen, enjoining such obedience to His laws as makes\nmanifest the path of national perpetuity and prosperity\n\u2014Grover Cleveland, delivered at the Princeton Sesqui-\nCentennial, 1896.\nEULOGY OF GARFIELD\n(Extract)\nGreat in life, he was surpassingly great in death. For no\ncause, in the very frenzy of wantonness and wickedness,\nby the red hand of murder, he was thrust from the full\ntide of this world's interest, from its hopes, its aspira-\ntions, its victories, into the visible presence of\ndeath\u2014and he did not quail. Not alone for the one short\nmoment in which, stunned and dazed, he could give up\nlife, hardly aware of its relinquishment, but through days\nof deadly languor, through weeks of agony, that was not\nless agony because silently borne, with clear sight and\ncalm courage, he looked into his open grave. What blight\nand ruin met his anguished eyes, whose lips may\ntell\u2014what brilliant, broken plans, what baffled, high am-\nbitions, what sundering of strong, warm, manhood's\nfriendships, what bitter rending of sweet household ties!\nBehind him a proud, expectant nation, a great host of\nsustaining friends, a cherished and happy mother, wear-\ning the full rich honors of her early toil and tears; the\nwife of his youth, whose whole life lay in his; the little\nboys not yet emerged from childhood's day of frolic; the\nfair young daughter; the sturdy sons just springing into\nclosest companionship, claiming every day and every day\nrewarding a father's love and care; and in his heart the\neager, rejoicing power to meet all demand. Before him,\ndesolation and great darkness! And his soul was not\nshaken. His countrymen were thrilled with instant, pro-\nfound and universal sympathy. Masterful in his mortal\nweakness, he became the centre of a nation's love, en-\nshrined in the prayers of a world. But all the love and all\nthe sympathy could not share with him his suffering. He\n306\ntrod the wine press alone. With unfaltering front he\nfaced death. With unfailing tenderness he took leave of\nlife. Above the demoniac hiss of the assassin's bullet he\nheard the voice of God. With simple resignation he\nbowed to the Divine decree.\n\u2014James G. Blaine, delivered at the memorial service\nheld by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\nEULOGY OF LEE\n(Extract)\nAt the bottom of all true heroism is unselfishness. Its\ncrowning expression is sacrifice. The world is suspicious\nof vaunted heroes. But when the true hero has come,\nand we know that here he is in verity, ah! how the hearts\nof men leap forth to greet him! how worshipfully we wel-\ncome God's noblest work\u2014the strong, honest, fearless,\nupright man. In Robert Lee was such a hero vouchsafed\nto us and to mankind, and whether we behold him de-\nclining command of the federal army to fight the battles\nand share the miseries of his own people; proclaiming on\nthe heights in front of Gettysburg that the fault of the\ndisaster was his own; leading charges in the crisis of\ncombat; walking under the yoke of conquest without a\nmurmur of complaint; or refusing fortune to come here\nand train the youth of his country in the paths of\nduty,\u2014he is ever the same meek, grand, self-sacrificing\nspirit. Here he exhibited qualities not less worthy and\nheroic than those displayed on the broad and open theat-\ner of conflict, when the eyes of nations watched his\nevery action. Here in the calm repose of civil and do-\nmestic duties, and in the trying routine of incessant\ntasks, he lived a life as high as when, day by day, he\nmarshalled and led his thin and wasting lines, and slept\nby night upon the field that was to be drenched again in\nblood upon the morrow. And now he has vanished from\nus forever. And is this all that is left of him\u2014this handful\nof dust beneath the marble stone? No! the ages answer\nas they rise from the gulfs of time, where lie the wrecks\nof kingdoms and estates, holding up in their hands as\ntheir only trophies, the names of those who have\nwrought for man in the love and fear of God, and in\n307\nlove\u2014unfearing for their fellow-men. No! the present an-\nswers, bending by his tomb. No! the future answers as\nthe breath of the morning fans its radiant brow, and its\nsoul drinks in sweet inspirations from the lovely life of\nLee. No! methinks the very heavens echo, as melt into\ntheir depths the words of reverent love that voice the\nhearts of men to the tingling stars.\nCome we then to-day in loyal love to sanctify our memor-\nies, to purify our hopes, to make strong all good intent\nby communion with the spirit of him who, being dead yet\nspeaketh. Come, child, in thy spotless innocence; come,\nwoman, in thy purity; come, youth, in thy prime; come,\nmanhood, in thy strength; come, age, in thy ripe wisdom;\ncome, citizen; come, soldier; let us strew the roses and\nlilies of June around his tomb, for he, like them, exhaled\nin his life Nature's beneficence, and the grave has con-\nsecrated that life and given it to us all; let us crown his\ntomb with the oak, the emblem of his strength, and with\nthe laurel the emblem of his glory, and let these guns,\nwhose voices he knew of old, awake the echoes of the\nmountains, that nature herself may join in his solemn re-\nquiem. Come, for here he rests, and\nOn this green bank, by this fair stream,\nWe set to-day a votive stone,\nThat memory may his deeds redeem?\nWhen, like our sires, our sons are gone.\n\u2014John Warwick Daniel, on the unveiling of Lee's statue\nat Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia,\n1883.\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.

Gladstone considered conversation to be\nboth an art and an accomplishment. Around the dinner table in\nhis home some topic of local or national interest, or some de-\nbated question, was constantly being discussed. In this way a\nfriendly rivalry for supremacy in conversation arose among the\nfamily, and an incident observed in the street, an idea gleaned\nfrom a book, a deduction from personal experience, was care-\nfully stored as material for the family exchange. Thus his early\nyears of practise in elegant conversation prepared the younger\nGladstone for his career as a leader and speaker.\nThere is a sense in which the ability to converse effectively is\nefficient public speaking, for our conversation is often heard by\nmany, and occasionally decisions of great moment hinge upon\nthe tone and quality of what we say in private.\nIndeed, conversation in the aggregate probably wields more\npower than press and platform combined. Socrates taught his\ngreat truths, not from public rostrums, but in personal con-\nverse. Men made pilgrimages\nand\nColeridge's home to be charmed and instructed by their\nspeech, and the culture of many nations was immeasurably in-\nfluenced by the thoughts that streamed out from those rich\nwell-springs.\nto Goethe's library\nMost of the world-moving speeches are made in the course of\nconversation. Conferences of diplomats, business-getting\n310\narguments, decisions by boards of directors, considerations of\ncorporate policy, all of which influence the political, mercantile\nand economic maps of the world, are usually the results of\ncareful though informal conversation, and the man whose opin-\nions weigh in such crises is he who has first carefully pondered\nthe words of both antagonist and protagonist.\nHowever important it may be to attain self-control in light so-\ncial converse, or about the family table, it is undeniably vital to\nhave oneself perfectly in hand while taking part in a moment-\nous conference. Then the hints that we have given on poise,\nalertness, precision of word, clearness of statement, and force\nof utterance, with respect to public speech, are equally applic-\nable to conversation.\nThe form of nervous egotism\u2014for it is both\u2014that suddenly\nends in flusters just when the vital words need to be uttered, is\nthe sign of coming defeat, for a conversation is often a contest.\nIf you feel this tendency embarrassing you, be sure to listen to\nHolmes's advice:\nAnd when you stick on conversational burs,\nDon't strew your pathway with those dreadful urs.\nHere bring your will into action, for your trouble is a wander-\ning attention. You must force your mind to persist along the\nchosen line of conversation and resolutely refuse to be diverted\nby any subject or happening that may unexpectedly pop up to\ndistract you. To fail here is to lose effectiveness utterly.\nConcentration is the keynote of conversational charm and ef-\nficiency. The haphazard habit of expression that uses bird-shot\nwhen a bullet is needed insures missing the game, for dip-\nlomacy of all sorts rests upon the precise application of precise\nwords, particularly\u2014if one may paraphrase Tallyrand\u2014in those\ncrises when language is no longer used to conceal thought.\nWe may frequently gain new light on old subjects by looking\nat word-derivations. Conversation signifies in the original a\nturn-about exchange of ideas, yet most people seem to regard\nit as a monologue. Bronson Alcott used to say that many could\nargue, but few converse. The first thing to remember in con-\nversation, then, is that listening\u2014respectful, sympathetic, alert\nlistening\u2014is not only due to our fellow converser but due to\n311\nourselves. Many a reply loses its point because the speaker is\nso much interested in what he is about to say that it is really no\nreply at all but merely an irritating and humiliating\nirrelevancy.\nSelf-expression is exhilarating. This explains the eternal im-\npulse to decorate totem poles and paint pictures, write poetry\nand expound philosophy. One of the chief delights of conversa-\ntion is the opportunity it affords for self-expression. A good\nconversationalist who monopolizes all the conversation, will be\nvoted a bore because he denies others the enjoyment of self-ex-\npression, while a mediocre talker who listens interestedly may\nbe considered a good conversationalist because he permits his\ncompanions to please themselves through self-expression. They\nare praised who please: they please who listen well.\nThe first step in remedying habits of confusion in manner,\nawkward bearing, vagueness in thought, and lack of precision\nin utterance, is to recognize your faults. If you are serenely un-\nconscious of them, no one\u2014least of all yourself\u2014can help you.\nBut once diagnose your own weaknesses, and you can over-\ncome them by doing four things:\n1. WILL to overcome them, and keep on willing.\n2. Hold yourself in hand by assuring yourself that you know\nprecisely what you ought to say. If you cannot do that, be quiet\nuntil you are clear on this vital point.\n3. Having thus assured yourself, cast out the fear of those\nwho listen to you\u2014they are only human and will respect your\nwords if you really have something to say and say it briefly,\nsimply, and clearly.\n4. Have the courage to study the English language until you\nare master of at least its simpler forms.\nConversational Hints\nChoose some subject that will prove of general interest to the\nwhole group. Do not explain the mechanism of a gas engine at\nan afternoon tea or the culture of hollyhocks at a stag party.\nIt is not considered good taste for a man to bare his arm in\npublic and show scars or deformities. It is equally bad form for\nhim to flaunt his own woes, or the deformity of some one else's\ncharacter. The public demands plays and stories that end hap-\npily. All the world is seeking happiness. They cannot long be in-\nterested in your ills and troubles. George Cohan made himself\n312\na millionaire before he was thirty by writing cheerful plays.\nOne of his rules is generally applicable to conversation: \"Al-\nways leave them laughing when you say good bye.\"\nDynamite the \"I\" out of your conversation. Not one man in\nnine hundred and seven can talk about himself without being a\nbore. The man who can perform that feat can achieve marvels\nwithout talking about himself, so the eternal \"I\" is not permiss-\nible even in his talk.\nIf you habitually build your conversation around your own in-\nterests it may prove very tiresome to your listener. He may be\nthinking of bird dogs or dry fly fishing while you are discussing\nthe fourth dimension, or the merits of a cucumber lotion. The\ncharming conversationalist is prepared to talk in terms of his\nlistener's interest. If his listener spends his spare time investig-\nating Guernsey cattle or agitating social reforms, the discrim-\ninating conversationalist shapes his remarks accordingly.\nRichard Washburn Child says he knows a man of mediocre abil-\nity who can charm men much abler than himself when he dis-\ncusses electric lighting. This same man probably would bore,\nand be bored, if he were forced to converse about music or\nMadagascar.\nAvoid platitudes and hackneyed phrases. If you meet a friend\nfrom Keokuk on State Street or on Pike's Peak, it is not neces-\nsary to observe: \"How small this world is after all!\" This obser-\nvation was doubtless made prior to the formation of Pike's\nPeak. \"This old world is getting better every day.\" \"Fanner's\nwives do not have to work as hard as formerly.\" \"It is not so\nmuch the high cost of living as the cost of high living.\" Such\nobservations as these excite about the same degree of admira-\ntion as is drawn out by the appearance of a 1903-model touring\ncar. If you have nothing fresh or interesting you can always re-\nmain silent. How would you like to read a newspaper that\nflashed out in bold headlines \"Nice Weather We Are Having,\"\nor daily gave columns to the same old material you had been\nreading week after week?\nQUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\n1.
